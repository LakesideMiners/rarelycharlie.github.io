*This is an unofficial interpretation of 7 Cups' rules governing offsite contact. It is for members and listeners. It does not all apply to therapists, or to some other people who have special roles at 7 Cups.*

**7 Cups permits offsite contact.**

For example, if you live with other people, work with other people, or meet other people socially, including on social media, all the people you have contact with in the past, now and in the future can join 7 Cups.

**Do not share contact information on 7 Cups.**

For example, do not use 7 Cups to share your e-mail address, social media handle, telephone number, links to your accounts on other websites, or any other information that someone could use to contact you offsite.

When you have to arrange contact with people you know offsite, you must make those arrangements offsite.

There are exceptions to this, explained below.

**Do not respond to contact information shared with you on 7 Cups.**

If someone on 7 Cups shares offsite contact information, do not use it to contact them. 

There are exceptions to this, explained below.

**Do not identify people you have offsite contact with as 7 Cups users.**

If you have offsite contact with a 7 Cups member or listener, do not refer to that contact on 7 Cups in a way that identifies the 7 Cups user.

For example, you can write, "I am worried about my son, John" but you cannot write, "I am worried about my son, @xxxxXxxxx0000."

### Exception: anonymous accounts

On 7 Cups you can share links to information that you place on other websites anonymously.

For example, you can put an image on <https://imgur.com> anonymously, then share a link to the image on 7 Cups.

### Exception: offsite accounts

You can make an offsite account on another website and share links to it on 7 Cups if:

- The name of the offsite account is the same as your 7 Cups screen name. (It's also OK to add 7 Cups to the name of the offsite account.)

- You only use the offsite account as a way of participating in the community at 7 Cups, and for no other purpose.

- The offsite account does not reveal any other way to contact you. (However, it can link back to your 7 Cups profile.)

- The offsite account does not capture any contact information from people who visit it. (For example, it must not capture e-mail addresses.)

- The offsite account is never used for 2-way communication with anyone. (For example, do not use e-mail, discussion or chat features.)

Examples:

1. A listener can use an offsite account to schedule chats, if these 5 rules are followed.

2. A member or listener can use an offsite account to publish documents and forms for the 7 Cups community, if these 5 rules are followed.

3. A member or listener can use an offsite social media account to promote 7 Cups, if these 5 rules are followed.

### Your personal link

Do not reveal your personal link in 7 Cups or in any offsite account where your 7 Cups screen name is visible. In these places, link to <https://7cups.com> or to your 7 Cups profile page.
