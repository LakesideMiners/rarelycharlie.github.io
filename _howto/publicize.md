You can publicize 7 Cups on the Internet and in the real world.

For some information about publicizing 7 Cups on the Internet, see: [Howto: Get referral clicks](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/howto/referral-clicks)

For some more resources, including a flyer that you can print and use in the real world, the official source is the page: [Link to Us](https://www.7cups.com/about/linktous.php) However, the resources on that page are out of date.

### Flyer

You can download an updated (but unofficial) flyer from the links below. There are two links because US (letter) and European (A4) paper sizes are slightly different.

If you need a translated version of the flyer, or updated versions of the other resources, contact [@RarelyCharlie](https://www.7cups.com/@RarelyCharlie).

### Button

Here's an updated (but unofficial) button that links to 7 Cups.

![button](/assets/button.png)

To use the button in your website, the code is:

~~~
<a href="https://www.7cups.com">
<img src="https://rarelycharlie.github.io/assets/button.png"
style="height:120px;width:120px;border:none;" /></a>
~~~
{:style="border: 1px solid #aaa; margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 1em;"}

You can modify the code so that the `href` contains your personal link.
