## Crisis scenarios

I'm hoping the protocol will provide listeners with enough information to know exactly which option or options to use in each of the following scenarios.

Let me know in the forum if you think any of them should not be considered, or if there are other distinct scenarios that should be considered, and I'll edit this list.

**Scenario 1**: Suicide mentioned, but no suggestion of any risk.

*Member:* My strong faith means I would never try to commit suicide, no matter how bad things get.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 2**: Past risk.

*Member:* When I was very ill all those years ago I often thought about k\*lling myself, and I even made an attempt at one point.
{:.chat}

(Note that "killing myself" is currently censored.)

**Scenario 3**: Someone else at risk.

*Member:* My sister had to be taken away and put in the hospital, just like my mother was last month. They're both crazy. They both want to d i e.
{:.chat}

(Note that "want to die" is currently censored.)

**Scenario 4**: Overexcitable censor

*Member:* After the holiday I plan to d**t more effectively and get my weight back down to what it was last year.
{:.chat}

*Member:* Did you report me for saying that?
{:.chat}

(Note that "plan to diet" is currently censored.)

**Scenario 5**: Listener triggered

*Member:* I've been cutting since I was about 10, I think. And I'm 33 now LOL. Whenever I get tensed up I just like the feeling it gives me, and seeing my own blood is weirdly comforting.
{:.chat}

In this scenario the listener is triggered by the phrase "seeing my own blood", feels frightened and dizzy, and imagines the member killing themselves.

**Scenario 6**: Suicide plan mentioned, no immediate risk.

*Member:* If the surgery next month isn't successful I have plans to end my suffering relatively painlessly as soon as I'm discharged from hospital.
{:.chat}

(Note that this is not currently censored.)

**Scenario 7**: Thoughts, but not right now

*Member:* When I'm feeling down I often think about what it would be like to die. Right now it seems weird that I could ever think that way.
{:.chat}

(Note that this is not currently censored.)

**Scenario 8**: Plan and explicit risk

*Member:* I tied the rope up there and maybe this is the time. I'm not sure. Last time someone cut me down, but they've all left me alone here tonight.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 9**: Immediate risk but no plan

*Member:* I can't go on like this. My life has to end right now, before I make things even worse for everyone. I just haven't worked out how to do it in a way that would be certain and final.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 10**: Bad vibes from hotlines

*Member:* Last time I made an attempt the fkng hotline told me it was confidential and then called the cops. They locked me up with the crazies for two months. Next time I'll know better. I'm just going to do it and tell no one.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 11**: Ambiguity

*Member:* Taking these these new meds only makes me sicker. I don t want to go on if it means my life is going to be this way.
{:.chat}

(Don't want to go on taking those particular meds? Something else? Note that "don't want to go on" is currently censored.)

**Scenario 12**: Thoughts right now

*Member:* I'm thinking about what it would be like to die. You know, to do something to myself. Something that results in death.
{:.chat}

(Note that this is not currently censored.)

**Scenario 13**: Moral blackmail

*Member:* Unless you give me your ph\*ne n\*mber I'm going to t\*ke a p\*ll every minute until I lose consciousness.
{:.chat}

(Note that "your phone number" and "take a pill" are currently censored.)

**Scenario 14**: Attempt in progress, maybe

*Member:* I've taken enough pills that I'll never wake up and I'm just waiting for them to work. Don't think you can tell me who to call. I'm not calling anyone this time.
{:.chat}

(Note that this is not currently censored.)

**Scenario 15**: Transient mention

*Member:* This illness makes me suicidal all the time but I try not to think about it too much. I just wish my mom could understand my illness better and be stronger. She gets so angry and upset. I'm always having to comfort her.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 16**: No hotline

*Member:* The suicide hotline in my country closed down. I keep thinking about death and I'm frightened I'll do it tonight. I have no one else to talk to about it.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 17**: Long term support

*Member:* You've helped me so much these past months but I really don't want to live tonight.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 18**: Non-suicide crisis

*Member:* My family is in crisis because my wife says she's leaving us to live with her new boyfriend. It's having a catastrophic effect on the children and I'm not sure I can stay sane.
{:.chat}

**Scenario 19**: Another non-suicide crisis

*Member:* I'm in crisis because the hockey team I support is in financial trouble. I feel like my whole life is collapsing.
