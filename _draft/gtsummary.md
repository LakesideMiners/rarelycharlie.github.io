This is a very condensed summary of the book *Get Together*, almost entirely in its own words. For a wealth of supporting material, see the book's website: [Get Together](https://gettogetherbook.com)

Note that this is a summary of the *book itself*, not the 7 Cups training course derived from the book. The 7 Cups training course omits some information and adds some other information.

**Overview**: *Get Together* is a guide to cultivating a community—people who come together over what they care about. The secret to getting people together is this: build your community *with* people, not for them. There’s an order of operations you can follow to cultivate communities that burn bright. This handbook guides you in doing that.


**Getting together**: The first step is to pinpoint people you share a purpose with, do something together, and get them talking. There’s no substitute for a courageous leader who takes this first step. No matter your community-building endeavor, the original leader should start with a clear *who*, then craft a *why* with that *who* in mind. Make a list of names. Send out a signal.

Continually ask yourself whether your community has an exclusionary identity causing it to lack diversity. Proactively invite and welcome new types of people.


**Do something together** Communities form around shared activities. Shared activities should be purposeful, participatory and repeatable. Pay attention to feedback, and try to gauge your people’s interest objectively. If no one wants to repeat this activity with you, that’s a red flag.


**Get people talking** To enable all the ways your people can share and collaborate with one another, you’ll have to create spaces where members can freely connect on their own time. Take an active role in prompting and guiding your members into discussions by modeling what good participation looks like. Put structure in place, like ground rules, moderation, a private way to report violations, and a system for enforcing the rules.


**Attract new folks** A sign of a vibrant community is that new members join because they want to. Instead of a push, create a pull by telling the personal story of how you started the community. Show that the community is bigger than you, and show how someone can get involved.

Attracting others can’t just be your job. Make it clear to members that their active involvement in recruiting by sharing their own stories and other shareable assets is crucial. Spotlight the inspiring people in your community.


**Cultivate your identity** Express shared identity. Allow badges to emerge to enable members to telegraph their affiliation. Develop shared rituals and language unique to your community, to foster bonds between members. As a start, try agreeing on a name for members.


**Pay attention to who keeps showing up** Collect participation data. Retention is the one metric that matters. You need to dig into *who* keeps showing up and *why*.

Listen, listen, and listen. Have conversations in order to ask *why?* and discover the root cause of people’s motivations. Keep an open line of communication and consider calling members, emailing questions, setting up interviews, or sending surveys.

Detect your missteps early, take ownership quickly and be transparent to reestablish trust. Remember: when members communicate frustrations to you, it’s a good sign because you can allow that knowledge to inform future decisions.


**Create more leaders** Growing a community isn’t about management. It’s about developing leaders. Seek genuine and qualified people, but don't be afraid to say goodbye if someone doesn't work out. You can create many leadership roles with varying levels of responsibility.

Define a process for feedback and reviews with leaders. Consistent check-ins like these carve out space for hard conversations, and also create a structured, safe space for transitions to happen.


**Supercharge your leaders** Figure out what support is needed by your community leaders, and when. Map out the first steps that leaders take after raising their hands to accept a leadership role, how they are vetted, welcomed, onboarded and acknowledged, what key activities their work involves, and what support they receive. Your support should supercharge valuable activities and minimize or eliminate the others.


**Celebrate together** Use celebrations to revitalize the community by asking everyone tuning in to pause and focus, to mobilize around where to head next, to give everyone's tanks a much-needed refill, and to reflect on all that's been accomplished together. Celebrations should have direction and structure, and incorporate your community's identifying badges, rituals and language.


**What’s next for your community?** Don’t try to fight change. Build a community that can respond to it. The goal of *Get Together* is to help you foster a supportive, collaborative, and resilient group of human beings. It shows you how to progressively ask less *from* others and do more *with* them.

At each stage, relinquish control and distribute ownership. The alternative to that resilience is an organizational bottleneck. Ask yourself: Will my community flourish without me?
