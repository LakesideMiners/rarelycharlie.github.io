This page describes how you might be able to enhance chats with a popup menu for inserting smileys in your messages.

The 15 smileys in the menu are supported by 7 Cups. When you use them, everyone sees the same smileys.

If you insert other smileys in your messages, some people might not see them in the same way you do, and some 
people might not be able to see them at all. This depends on what kind of device they are using and how it is configured.

### Who can use the smiley menu?

You can probably use the smiley menu if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on a computer.

You might be able to use the smiley menu if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on an Android device.

You cannot use the smiley menu on an Apple iOS device.

You cannot enhance the editor if you use the 7 Cups App on any kind of device.

### What you need
To use the smiley menu, you need to install two things in this order: 

1. First install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in your web browser.

   If your web browser is not compatible with Tampermonkey, then you cannot proceed with the next step
   (but you might be able to use the method for Apple iOS instead).

2. Next, install the [7 Cups - Smiley menu](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/????????????????) script.

To install each of these in turn, click the relevant link and follow the instructions.

### Using the menu

To use the menu, click on the yellow button at the left of your message:

Then click on one of the supported smileys:

The smiley's keyboard equivalent is inserted in your message:

### Keyboard shortcuts

You can also use the menu from your keyboard using these keys:

|Ctrl + `I`|Open the smiley menu in keyboard mode|
|<span style="font-size: 108%; font-weight: bold;">ðŸ   ðŸ ¡ ðŸ £ ðŸ ¢</span>|Select a smiley|
|Space bar|Insert the smiley in your message and close the menu|
|Ctrl + `I`, Escape|Cancel the menu|
|Any other key|Normal key action, and cancel the menu|

In keyboard mode an outline shows you the selected smiley. Press the space bar to insert it into your message:

**Note:** If you press the Return or Enter key, it sends the message in the usual way.
