You get referral clicks when someone comes to 7 Cups by seeing your personal link somewhere else and clicking on it.

To find your personal link, go to 7cups.com, log in, and look for the My Personal Link section, usually near the bottom right of the page. Copy the link and paste it where other people will see it. You can publish it anywhere you likeâ€”for example, on social media, and in e-mail and forum signatures.

Your personal link is exclusive to you but anonymous, so that no one can use it to discover your 7 Cups screen name.

In general, you should keep your identities inside 7 Cups separate from your identities outside 7 Cups.

Inside 7 Cups:
- Do not reveal your personal link.
- Do not reveal your real name.
- Do not reveal your e-mail address.
- Do not reveal your social media handles.
- If you have listener and member accounts, do not reveal your other 7 Cups identity.

Outside 7 Cups:
- Do not reveal your 7 Cups screen name. Only your personal link is OK to reveal.

(Slightly different rules apply to admins, therapists, and members of some teams.)
