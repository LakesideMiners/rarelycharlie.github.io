This is an unofficial reading list for listeners, curated by [@RarelyCharlie](https://www.7cups.com/@RarelyCharlie) and presented in order of publication date within each section. For more information, see [A reading list for listeners](#). \[LINK TO BE ADDED\]

# Listening and related techniques

Books about listening in the wider context of techniques that help people. Rogers (1942) is the most important book in this entire list.

#### Carl R. Rogers (1942) _Counseling and Psychotherapy: Newer Concepts in Practice_

A book about what we now call active listening, explaining where the idea of active listening originally came from, how it helps people, and how to do it. Full of real examples transcribed from recorded sessions. 

If you're a listener, or thinking of becoming a listener, and if you only read one book from the list, I recommend that this should be the one (the first half of it, anyway).

# Mental illness and society

Books that discuss mental illness in relation to culture and society.

#### Johann Hari (2018) _Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the Unexpected Solutions_

A journalist and storyteller explores some of the causes of depression, anxiety and addiction. The unexpected solutions include what 7 Cups was created to do.
