You can find listeners who have received good ratings from other people by searching
for listeners who have certain badges. Here's a list. Click on the name of a badge to
search for listeners who have that badge:

| Name of badge       | Ratings | Listeners |
|:--------------------|--------:|----------:|
| Verified\*          | 2       | 5,000     |
| Jester of Smiles    | 10      | 19,000    |
| Clerk of Bear Hugs  | 25      | 6,000     |
| Piper of Dedication | 50      | 2,000     |
| Baron of Big-Hearts | 100     | 500       |
| Knight of Smilehood | 200     | 100       |


The Verified Listener badge requires one good review by a listener and at least one good 
written review by a member or guest. The other badges in the table require 4-star or 
5-star ratings by members and guests.

Possibly the best way to find a good listener is to click on Jester of Smiles in the
table. These listeners have at least 10 good ratings, and there are nearly 20,000 of them
to choose from.

Once a listener has earned the Jester of Smiles badge, they can earn the other badges in
the table if they just keep going for long enough. It's not certain that they become any
better at listening.
