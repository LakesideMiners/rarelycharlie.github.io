7 Cups requires members to agree to a [Member Agreement](https://www.7cups.com/inc/memberTOS.html), and requires listeners to agree to a [Listener Agreement](https://www.7cups.com/listenerAgreement.php). This unofficial guide discusses the interpretation of some problematic parts of these agreements.

The opinions stated in this guide are those of the author, @RarelyCharlie, and may not fully reflect 7 Cups policy.

There is a third agreement for members who pay for online therapy with professional therapists, but this third agreement is not discussed here. There is almost certainly a fourth agreement for therapists, but this agreement is not discussed here either.

### The agreements

The listener and member agreements were written long ago in terms of 7 Cups' history. As 7 Cups changed, the agreements were not always updated. As a result, some parts of the agreements no longer make any sense.

The parts of the agreements that do make sense still apply to members and listeners. This guide discusses some parts of the agreements that might not entirely make sense.

The agreements have alternative names, such as terms of service, or terms and conditions. There is only one member agreement and only one listener agreement. The various other names all refer to these agreements.

### Telephone contact

When 7 Cups first began it was a telephone service. Later, a text chat system was added. Members liked the text chat much more than they liked the telephone system. So the telephone system was dropped and now we only have text chat.

Where the listener and member agreements mention the telephone system, the information no longer applies.

For example, the listener agreement says: 

> Welcome to 7Cups.com (“7 Cups” or “7 Cups of Tea” or “Site”), the Web site that is a platform for on-line and phone based listening, advice, and professional consulting services.

There is no phone based listening at 7 Cups.

Do not share telephone numbers (or any other personal contact information) on 7 Cups. If someone shares a telephone number with you, do not call the number.

### Offsite contact

The listener agreement places irrational restrictions on offsite contact. It says:

> All contact between Listeners, consumers and any other users who are introduced through the 7 Cups of Tea platform must be conducted only through the 7 Cups of Tea platform.

This says that if you interact with someone on 7 Cups, then you cannot later have any contact with the same person in real life or on other websites. This is irrational, because you cannot control who you meet in real life or on other websites.

The 7 Cups community also depends on contact between listeners and members on platforms such as Google docs (and, indeed, the page your are reading now).

### Advice

When 7 Cups first began, listeners could be paid for giving advice. Later, this arrangement was dropped. Now we have professional therapists on 7 Cups, and members can pay for online therapy and advice from professionals.

Where the listener and member agreements mention payments or advice, the information no longer applies.

For example, the listener agreement says:

> 7Cups.com provides a platform where a Listener may present his or her profile information, expertise, and sell listening or advice or services to interested 7 Cups of Tea users (“Members”).

If you are a listener, do not give advice to members. Do not try to get payment from members. Giving paid advice at 7 Cups is something only professional therapists can do.

If you are a member, do not accept advice from listeners. Do not agree to pay any listener. Only accept advice at 7 Cups from professional therapists who are paid through 7 Cups.

### Suicide

When 7 Cups first began as a telephone service it was not intended to replace more specialized suicide prevention helplines. It was important not to give the impression that 7 Cups is a suicide prevention service.

Where the member agreement mentions suicide, the information is not accurate:

> IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE, IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU MAY BE A DANGER TO YOURSELF OR TO OTHERS OR IF YOU OTHERWISE HAVE ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY CALL 911 (OR THE RELEVANT EMERGENCY NUMBER IN YOUR COUNTRY) AND NOTIFY THE POLICE OR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.

This information is false. Do not call emergency services to get help with your thoughts or feelings. In some places, calling emergency services when there is no physical emergency may be a criminal offense.

If you are a member who has thoughts about suicide, you can seek emotional support at 7 Cups from some listeners who are willing to discuss this subject. Some listeners might not be willing to discuss the subject, and they can transfer you to another listener.

If you are taking action intended to end your life (not just thinking about it), do not use 7 Cups for support. Instead, call a local suicide prevention helpline. You can most easily find your local helpline from local information, but if this is difficult you might be able to find it on the Internet at suicide.org or by searching.

If you have already taken action to harm yourself, and the harm is serious, do not use 7 Cups for support. Get emergency medical help by calling your local emergency services.

If you are listener, and a member has thoughts about suicide, consider providing emotional support just like you would for any other distressing thoughts. If you cannot provide support for personal reasons, transfer the member to another listener in the usual way.

If you are a listener, and a member is taking action to end their life (not just thinking about it), refer the member to their local suicide prevention service. Once they have contacted that service, end the chat.

If you are a listener, and a member has a medical emergency of any kind, refer the member to their local emergency services. Once they have contacted emergency services, end the chat.

Listeners must not contact any services on behalf of members, and listeners should not provide contact information that might not work for the member. For example, do not provide US helpline numbers to members who might not be in the US.
