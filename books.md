This is an unofficial reading list for listeners, intended to provide background information about the work listeners do at 7 Cups.

The list is curated by [@RarelyCharlie](https://www.7cups.com/@RarelyCharlie) and presented in order of publication date within each section. For more information, see [A reading list for listeners](#). \[LINK TO BE ADDED\]

# Listening and related techniques

Listening in the wider context of techniques that help people. Rogers (1942) is the most important book in this entire list.

#### Carl R. Rogers (1942) _Counseling and Psychotherapy: Newer Concepts in Practice_

A book about what we now call active listening, explaining where the idea of active listening originally came from, how it helps people, and how to do it. Full of real examples transcribed from recorded sessions. 

If you're a listener, or thinking of becoming a listener, and if you only read one book from the list, I recommend that this should be the one (the first half of it, anyway).

#### Carl R. Rogers (1961) _On Becoming a Person: A Therapists View of Psychotherapy_

Sets out the basis of client-centered therapy, which builds on active listening and extends it. Some of the philosophy and techniques described could optionally be used by listeners at 7 Cups who want to go beyind the basics, but some couldn't.

# Mental illness and society

Mental illness in relation to culture and society.

#### Robert Whitaker (2010) _Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America_

A journalist investigates the reasons for the recent huge increase in mental illness in America.

#### Johann Hari (2018) _Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the Unexpected Solutions_

A journalist and storyteller explores some of the causes of depression, anxiety and addiction. The unexpected solutions include what 7 Cups was created to do.

# 7 Cups

7 Cups' background story.

#### Paul Graham (2004) _Hackers and Painters_

An insider view of the Silicon Valley culture where 7 Cups grew up. A collection of loosely related essays. Some tech jargon (which you can mostly skim over). Some very techie chapters that you could skim over, but it's worthwhile reading enough to get a flavour of the culture, which explains a lot about 7 Cups.

[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3327779M/Hackers_painters)

#### Glen Moriarty (2016) _7 Cups for the Searching Soul_

A somewhat confused explanation of the reasons for 7 Cups' existence, by its founder. Examines the role of denial and distraction in preventing people from realising their true potential, and how love and care are the antidote. 

# Individual stories

Biography and fiction describing mental illness.

### Fyodor Dostoevsky (1866) _Crime and Punishment_

Classic tale of madness with terrible consequences, and of recovery through love.

#### Kay Redfield Jamison (1997) _An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness_

First-hand account of living with bipolar disorder, by a renowned clinical psychologist, now a professor of psychiatry.

# Psychotherapy

The techniques of psychotherapy, which are mostly based on active listening but go much further. For interest only, especially for listeners considering future training to become therapists. Not intended to encourage listeners to play at being amateur therapists while they are volunteers at 7 Cups!

#### Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud (1895) _Studies on Hysteria_

Only for historical interest. This book is thought to be the first to describe listening as a treatment for mental illness. In the first of the cases studies in this book, Fr√§ulein Anna O., the patient demanded to talk while Dr. Breuer only listened to her. Thus, the talking cure is said to have been invented by this patient, whose real name was Bertha Pappenheim. According to some reports she recovered and became well known as a social pioneer, but the story has been disputed.

#### Irvin D. Yalom (2009) _The Gift of Therapy_

This _Open Letter to a New Generation of Therapists and their Patients_ provides a fascinating insight into the mind of a very experienced therapist. It shows how psychotherapy (mostly long-term existential therapy and group therapy) builds on the very basic techniques of active listening.

In 85 short chapters, with little jargon and many anecdotes and quotes.

#### Danny Wedding and Raymond J. Corsini (2014) _Case Studies in Psychotherapy_

A collection of case studies illustrating different approaches to psychotherapy, with transcripts of actual therapy sessions. The therapists are all experts in their respective approaches, and they explain their thinking as they work with each client.
