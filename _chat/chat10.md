This chat is not a simulation like the others in this series. It's an excerpt from a detailed record of real-life counselling,
which could equally be long-term listening at 7 Cups. 

The client, here called Barbara, is sixteen and in high school in the US. She saw the counsellor, a psychologist, for 
fifteen one-hour sessions, during which Barbara was able to resolve some confusion abut what we would now call her gender
identity. 

But all this happened about 80 years ago. It appeared in a book published in 1942. Some of the language and 
culture is different from today, and the term gender identity didn't exist back then.

The counsellor's approach closely matches the approach taught in listener training at 7 Cups. It is based on accurate empathic 
reflection, and the counsellor is careful to avoid making any suggestions that Barbara didn't introduce into the
conversation herself. The counsellor is also careful to avoid trying to solve Barbara's problems.

The story of Barbara's counselling is in this 12-page PDF document: [Barbara](../assets/Barbara.pdf)

The book it came from is worth reading from cover to cover. It's _Counselling and Psychotherapy: Newer Concepts in
Practice, by Carl R. Rogers_ ([Google Books](https://books.google.fr/books/about/Counseling_and_psychotherapy.html?id=nbU4AAAAIAAJ)).
