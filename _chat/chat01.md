In this fictional chat you shadow a listener called Morinda taking a general request. Morinda allows you to choose what to say to the member. At least one of the choices will always be OK, and sometimes more than one of them will be OK.

You start the chat with 5 stars, but every time you choose wrongly you lose a star. If you lose all 5 stars the chat will end immediately.
