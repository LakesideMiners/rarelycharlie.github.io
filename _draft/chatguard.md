If you're a listener, ChatGuard guards your chat list from unsolicited messages. If you're a member it doesn't do anything useful at all.

### How ChatGuard works

Your chat list is the list of chats that appears at the top left on your Path page and on every chat page. Noni is at the very top, and your most recent chats are below, with your least recent chats at the bottom. The list contains about 24 chats when expanded, fewer when collapsed.

ChatGuard removes chats from members you have never sent a message to or replied to. It doesn't do anything else. It has no effect on general requests or personal requests that you take, because in those chats you always send at least one message.

ChatGuard does not affect messages from other listeners, or from members you chatted to long ago. Those chats continue to appear in your chat list normally.

Members whose chats are removed by ChatGuard receive no notification. It appears to them that you are ignoring all their messages.

For this reason, when you use ChatGuard you must place a clear warning at the top of your profile saying something like: "I do not respond to unsolicited messages."

To remove chats from members you have replied to in the past, either hide the chat using the (Ã—) button or block the conversation in the normal way.
