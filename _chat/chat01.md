In this fictional chat you shadow a listener called Morinda taking a general request. Morinda allows you to choose what to say to the member. At least one of the choices will always be OK, and sometimes more than one of them will be OK.

You start the chat with 5 stars, but every time you choose wrongly you lose a star. If you lose all 5 stars the chat will end immediately.

- 2Q To get started, greet the member. Choose one of these greetings:
  - 26 What advice do you need from me today? I can answer any question!
  - 1 Hi! Welcome to 7 Cups! I'm Morinda.
  - 25 I am so happy and excited to be able to chat with you.
- 2M Hi, I'm Al.
- 1M I need some advice.
- 2Q Choose how to respond:
  - 26 Wonderful! I can assure you that all my advice is the very best advice.
  - 34 Oh, sweetie, just tell me what you need.
  - 7 OK
- 1I It's OK to need advice, obviously...
- 0I ...but let's try to find out more.
- 0Q Choose how to follow up:
  - 7 Advice about what?
  - 28 Have you lost your job?
  - 24 You must be feeling so confused and lost.
- 3M It's my boss. He was my assistant until last month and now he's been promoted above me.
- 1M And that was OK. He's someone I have great respect for. He'll go far.
- 1M But he's been very nasty to me since he got the promotion.
- 1M I don't know what to do.
- 1Q Choose how to respond:
  - 27 What about going to his boss to complain about this bullying?
  - 28 It sounds like he is insecure.
  - 3 You're unhappy about how he's treating you.
- 4I No reply yet, so try a closed question.
- 0L Do you feel he's bullying you?
- 1M No, I don't feel I'm a victim.
- 1M I've been doing this job a long time.
- 2M I just don't know how to relate to him now.
- 1L Your formal relationship has changed, so you don't feel you can relate to him the same way you did before.
- 1M Exactly.
- 1L Is that realy true?
- 1M Is what really true?
- 1L That you can't relate to him the same way you did before.
- 1M Haha! Maybe not.
- 0I Oops! That was bordering on being advice.
- 0I Better back off.
- 6M Maybe he still wants our relationship
- 0M In fact, maybe he still needs our relationship to be the way it was.
- 0I Sounds good, but let's not push it.
- 0L What kind of relationship did you have before his promotion?
- 1M I was very much his mentor.
- 2L A father figure, almost?
- 0I A bit of a wild guess there.
- 1M You could say that.
- 0I Got lucky with the guess!
- 1L Could that explain how he's behaving now?
- 2M That he feels I've turned against him?
- 0M I need to think about that.
- 1M He's been pitched into a responsible position and has a lot of pressure.
- 0I Stay with the member's feelings and summarize.
- 1L So that feeling you had of not knowing what to do has become a feeling that there are things you need to think through.
- 3M And maybe negotiate with him, yes.
- 0I Let's validate that idea.
- 0L Yes, and negotiate with him.
- 8I Taking a long time. Maybe we're done?
- 2M Thank you for listening to me.
- 0I Yes, we're done.
- 1L We can chat again another time, if you like.
- 1M Yes, thank you, I'd like that.
- 1L OK
- 0L Take care.
- 1M And you.
