In this fictional chat you shadow a listener called Morinda taking a general request.

Once the chat gets going, Morinda allows you to choose what to say to the member. The correct choice every time is the one that accurately reflects the member's feelings. Any other choice is wrong, even if it reflects something else the member said.

You start the chat with 5 stars, but every time you choose wrongly you lose a star. If you lose all 5 stars the chat will end immediately.

Remember to press the blue Send button to send each message.
