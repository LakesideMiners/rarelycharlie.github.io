When you are using 7 Cups in a web browser you can usually hide the intrusive advertising for therapy.

This works in most web browsers on computers and in some web broswers on Android devices.
It does not work on Apple iOS devices (iPads and iPhones).

It hides the main therapy ads in the forums, and also the smaller ad in the navigation bar at the top.

There are two (or maybe three) steps:

1. Install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/). This is a browser extension that goes inside your web browser.
On its home page you can see which web browsers it supports.

2. Install [7 Cups - Hide therapy ads](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/26957-7-cups-hide-therapy-ads).
This is a script that goes inside Tampermonkey.

3. If 7 Cups is already open, reload the page.
