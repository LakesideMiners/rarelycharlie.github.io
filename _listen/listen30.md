Empathy is made even more difficult when emotion is only implied by the words the member uses.

This can be extremely challenging. You constantly have to ask yourself, “What's the feeling here?”

Member: *“I think of his grave sometimes, even though I never visit it, and then I think of him and how things were, and people sometimes ask me what I'm smiling at LOL.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You remember him fondly.”*
{: .conv}

You have to take the risk that you'll sometimes pick up an implied feeling wrongly. You're communicating to the member that their feelings are so important you'll go out on a limb to try and understand them. If you do get it wrong, you can usually recover quickly:

Member: *“I tried one thing and another but nothing worked, so I just got to the point where something snapped.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You were so angry.”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“No, it was more like terrible disappointment took over.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“A  terrible disappointment that nothing you tried had worked.”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“Exactly.”*
{: .conv}

If you're not sure about an implied feeling, it's OK to indicate that you're not sure. You could change the wording, or you could simply make it into a question:

Member: *“I don't know why I think about him so much. Right now, you know, I'm wondering what he's doing. I can't concentrate on anything LOL”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You love him?”*
{: .conv}

After the quiz, we'll look at summarizing long statements that you cannot reflect.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="True,False"}

*“It was such a relief to all of us when he finally passed away. I don't know how we had coped.”
