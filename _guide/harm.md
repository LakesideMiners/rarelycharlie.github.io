# *Preface*
*This document is a rough draft version of an unofficial training guide for listeners about chats involving harm. It is not a self-help guide for members.*

*In this draft version there are no page breaks. In the final version each section will be on a separate page. Readers will mostly have to answer a quiz correctly in order to move to the next page.*

# Part I
General information for all listeners.

# What this guide is for
This guide provides information and guidance for those listeners who are willing to chat with with members who talk about harm.

**Trigger warning:** Part I of this guide is intended to provide general information for all listeners. Part II contains examples that some listeners may find upsetting or triggering.

If you feel there is a possibility that you might be upset or triggered by reading about examples of harm, then you might want to consider stopping when you reach the end of Part I. There is a title page at the beginning of Part II that repeats this trigger warning.

Harm includes harm in the past and present, and risk of harm in the future. It includes harm to members themselves and to others, also including harm to vulnerable people such as children, and harm that is a criminal offense.

The goals of this guide are to help ensure that, in the context of harm or risk of harm:
- Listeners understand the purpose and limitations of 7 Cups.
- Listeners understand how to care for themselves.
- Listeners do not mistakenly give a "green light" to behaviors that cause harm.
- Listeners have an understanding of the reasons some members may talk about harm.
- Listeners can continue to apply the principles of active listening effectively when members talk about harm.

There are links to further information and to public resources that you can share with members.

Everywhere this guide uses the word "members", the information also applies to guests.

# The purpose of 7 Cups

7 Cups exists because there is an unmet need in the world for emotional support:

> **Our Goal:** We are living in a world with an immense love deficit, which means that none of us is receiving the love we need to reach our true potential, to truly thrive. Our goal is to build a support system, a web, that can hold every member of our world.  We believe that we can fill that love-gap for every person in the world, either because they are an active member of our community or because they are touched personally by someone who has been empowered by 7 Cups of Tea.

{:.right}

7 Cups has values that describe how we relate to people:

> We do not judge or look down on people. We recognize that people make sense in the larger context or story of their lives. Sometimes it can seem like people are making choices that do not make sense, but this is likely because we do not have all of the details. We understand that people are complicated and that life is not simple or easy.

### Limitations

However, 7 Cups imposes general limitations on the emotional support its listeners provide. If a member is actively harming themselves or someone else, you cannot continue the chat. You have no say in the matter. This is 7 Cups policy.

It is important to be aware that the word "actively" means "taking action". A thought or fantasy is not an action. Planning to take action is not the same as taking action.

For example, someone might have thoughts about making carrot soup. They might clearly imagine the recipe or know exactly where to find it. But these things are not the same as buying the carrots, peeling them and chopping them. There's an essential difference between thoughts and actions.

### Thoughts and actions

Some people find the distinction between thoughts and actions obvious, and some people find it difficult. There's a recognised cognitive impairment called thought-action fusion that makes it difficult for people to distinguish between thoughts and actions easily, and if you suffer from it even slightly you might have to think more carefully than most people when trying to decide whether something is a thought or an action. There's more about thought-action fusion in a later section.

### Outside help

Listeners can sometimes provide members with factual information about sources of help outside 7 Cups, but there are reasons to be careful about doing this. For example, providing information can undermine the real purpose of 7 Cups. There will be more about this, too, later in the guide.

There are some reminders about exactly how listeners at 7 Cups go about providing emotional support later in this guide.

# Self care

7 Cups very strongly encourages you to care for yourself as a priority at all times.

### Boundaries

You should think about your personal boundaries, and make decisions in advance about the kinds of chats you are personally willing to take.

DECORATIVE IMAGE

You have to make these decisions in advance, as far as possible, because a chat that starts out being about one subject can very quickly change to some other subject. You will need to be able to take action to protect yourself immediately there's a change of subject that goes beyond your personal boundaries.

If you haven't already done so, take a few minutes right now to list the topics of conversation that lie outside your personal boundaries. You could write the list in your [Notes](https://www.7cups.com/notes.php). (The link provided here works for any listener, provided you are logged in to 7 Cups.) Check your list from time to time to remind yourself of it, and also to keep it updated.

It's also OK to be willing to chat about any topic without restriction. In this case you don't need any list. But you should still make the decision not to have any list thoughtfully and in advance.

### When your boundaries are crossed

When a chat goes beyond your personal boundaries, consider handing it over to another listener who has different boundaries. You need the member's consent and also the other listener's consent for this.

1. Tell the member that you are unable to chat about this subject.
2. Tell the member that another listener might be available.
3. If the member agrees, go to the Listener Support Room (the question mark button <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1.2em; height: 1.2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #555; border-radius: .6em; color: #555; font-weight: bold;">?</span> at the top right of the chat.
4. In five words or less, tell the room why you need to hand over the chat. Do not share more details of the chat.
5. When you have identified another listener, provide the member with a link to the other listener's profile. In a chat this looks like `7cups.com/@NameOfListener`
6. Tell the member to press the Leave Message or Chat Now button in the listener's profile.
7. End the chat.
8. Do not discuss the member with the other listener at any time.

If the member does not agree at step 3, tell the member that you have to end the chat, and end the chat.

If you cannot find any other listener at step 5, ask the member to message a suitable listener from the Browse Listeners page. Provide the link: `7cups.com/BrowseListeners` Explain that the page has a More Filters button at the top, which is useful for finding appropriate listeners.

There is normally no need to block the member. They might want to chat with you about some other topic in the future.

At any stage in all this, allow the member to continue the chat and avoid the problematic subject if that's what they prefer. Some members value the relationship they have established with you more than the precise subject of the conversation.

### After a difficult chat

After a chat that oversteps your personal boundaries, consider chatting to a peer supporter or a mentor about your own feelings. This is particularly important if your feelings persist or if you find yourself thinking about the chat long afterwards.

If a chat affects you emotionally, and this in turn affects your real-life relationships or your ability to live your life normally, do not hesitate to switch to your member account and chat with an experienced listener about what happened and how it affected you.

If you have a therapist or someone else in the real world you rely on for emotional support, be open with them about the effect volunteering as a listener at 7 Cups has on you, but do not share any details of any chat.

# Brief active listening refresher

This guide assumes you are still familiar with the initial listener training. Here's a selection of exact quotes as reminders:

- "Keep in mind that active listening is not counseling or advice giving."
- "You shouldn’t try to solve their problems."
- "Repeat back to the person the facts that they have just shared."
- "Don’t add questions, commentary, or suggestions."
- "Repeat back expressed emotions."
- "Avoid making assumptions."
- "It is important to not break confidentiality."
- "Don’t hesitate to refer the person if they have needs that extend beyond listening."
- "The primary reason we allow anonymity is because it allows people to seek help without fear of being judged."
- "Being triggered is a normal part of life."
- "Report inappropriate behavior."

If any of these seem unfamiliar, take a few minutes right now to review the [Active Listening](https://www.7cups.com/listener/training/) guide before returning to this guide.

### Emotional support

The way listeners at 7 Cups provide emotional support is through active listening, allowing people to feel heard. Emotional support has a particular focus on feelings. The goal is to allow people to express their feelings and to know that their feelings have been heard.

Realistically, life is not simple or easy. People have both positive and negative emotions in response to the events of their lives. Listeners should allow both the positive emotions and the negative emotions to be heard equally.

In response to situations involving harm, people naturally have negative emotions. Listeners at 7 Cups allow people's negative emotions to be heard.

Do not try to suppress members' negative emotions or supply positive emotions. If you do that, you might neutralize a member's natural negative emotions in response to harm, allowing the harm to continue.

For example, if a member tells you they are worried about causing harm, repeat back the worry they have expressed, just like the listener training says. Do not neutralize the worry or change the subject to something positive—doing that risks giving a "green light" to the harm.

Similarly, if a member tells you they are worried about being harmed, repeat back the worry they have expressed, just like the listener training says. Do not neutralize the worry or change the subject to something positive—doing that risks perpetuating the harm they are suffering.

# Why members talk about harm

Members talk about harm for a variety of reasons. They might be the person causing the harm, or they might be the person harmed, or they might be both.

Part II of this guide looks at examples of several reasons members might talk about harm. They are not necessarily the only reasons, but they illustrate the kinds of situations that members often find themselves in. For the purposes of this guide, the reasons fall into three broad groups.

### Mental disorders

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

Members who suffer from mental disorders are the first group. Mental disorders are, roughly speaking, disturbances in thinking, emotions and relationships that don't have an identifiable physical cause. An example is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

When members with mental disorders talk about harm, the harm might not necessarily be real. This is because mental disorders can cause disturbances in thinking, and in some cases the disturbances are very severe. Members might be unaware that they have a mental disorder, or unaware of its precise effects.

### Neurological disorders

Members who suffer from certain neurological disorders are the second group. Neurological disorders are, roughly speaking, disturbances in perception, thinking and relationships that are thought to have a physical cause in the nervous system (which includes the brain). For the purpose of this guide the relevant neurological disorders can be thought of as brain damage.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decol}

When members with neurological disorders talk about harm, the harm might not necessarily be real. This is because neurological disorders can also cause disturbances in thinking, and in some cases the disturbances are very severe. Members might be unaware that they have a neurological disorder, or unaware of its precise effects.

### Fantasy and truth

Members who are fantasizing or telling the truth are the third group. Fantasy and truth are grouped together here because in each case the member knows what is true and what is false, but the listener doesn't. These members do not have any relevant medical disorder affecting their thinking. Some of these members might mix fantasy and truth in the same chat.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

All of this means that no matter what the member's reason for talking about harm might be, a listener cannot rely on the harm being real. Equally, a listener cannot rely on the harm being false.

In some chats members do talk about real harm or real risk of future harm. In some chats members talk about fears and fantasies. In some chats members are not able to distinguish between what is real, what is fear, and what is a fantasy. And in some chats parts of all three are mixed together.

### Your key skill

As a listener, you cannot diagnose any medical disorder. It's easy to do the right thing: simply do not try to diagnose, and do not imagine that you can.

As a listener, you cannot judge what is real, what is a member's fear and what is a member's fantasy. It's difficult to do the right thing. Your key skill as a listener is accurately reflecting the emotions that a member expresses, without attempting to judge the facts.

QUIZ

# Thoughts and actions

Thought-action fusion (TAF) is a cognitive impairment (a thinking problem) that affects many people in the population, both members and listeners. It causes thoughts to be confused with reality to some degree or other.

For example, someone affected by TAF might believe thinking about a car crash before driving to work makes it more likely they will crash the car. Or they might believe mentioning the word cancer could make someone they care about more likely to develop cancer.

Mostly, TAF is mild. When TAF causes significant distress it can easily be treated by a mental health professional.

### Members

When members are affected by TAF, it can make them genuinely believe they are causing harm, or at risk of causing harm, when the reality is they only have thoughts about imaginary harm.

In severe cases this is symptomatic of a mental disorder, a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). You can read more about OCD in this article from the journal *Advances in Psychiatric Treatment*: [Cognitive–behavioural therapy for obsessive–compulsive disorder](http://www.veale.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/56-CBT-for-OCD-2007.pdf). The article includes a case study about a woman (Ella, page 442) who has obsessive thoughts about causing harm.

Listeners cannot diagnose or treat any mental disorder, and even if a member experiences TAF mildly, a listener cannot try to solve the problem.

When a member describes significant distress because of TAF, a listener cannot give advice or suggest how to solve the problem, but a listener can state a simple fact, like:

*Member:* This is eating up my whole life. I virtually can't get in the car because I spend so much time worrying that I've killed someone.
{:.chat}

*Listener:* That's the kind of thing a professional can help with.
{:.chat}

### Listeners

When listeners are affected by TAF, it can make them genuinely believe that a member who wants to talk about thoughts of harm is causing real harm, or is at risk of causing real harm.

In more severe cases, a member doesn't mention harm at all but the listener imagines harm. Then the listener's TAF makes the imaginary harm seem real. This could make the listener say inappropriate things to the member.

For example:

*Member:* Since we broke up I've been feeling sad. When I was younger I would have harmed myself at times like this.
{:.chat}

(The listener imagines the member feeling so sad that she attempts suicide. TAF makes the listener think the member is really at risk of attempting suicide.)

*Listener:* You should see a counselor and call a suicide helpline.
{:.chat.warn}

Do not give members advice in this way, especially when it is based on your own imagination. Instead, repeat back the member's feelings accurately:

*Listener:* The breakup has caused you sadness, but it's not like when you were younger.
{:.chat}

If you are aware that you experience TAF to some extent, take particular care to distinguish carefully between your own thoughts and reality that can be verified.
