Welcome to this alternative training course in listening at 7 Cups.

This is *not* the official training course. This alternative course does not enable you to become a listener at 7 Cups. If you are looking for the official training course, go here: New Listener Training

You can take this alternative course if you want to learn about active listening at 7 Cups, either because you are a guest or a member interested in supporting other 7 Cups users or people in real life, or because you are already a listener and you would like a refresher course.

### Listening styles

Listeners all go about their listening in slightly different ways. The style of listening that this course teaches is not quite the same as the style of listening that the official course teaches.

When you are a listener you must make your own choices about your style of listening. Many listeners adopt a style that is different from the style taught in the official training, and different from the style taught in this alternative training.

### How this course works

This is an online course that has four chapters. There are about a dozen sections in each chapter. You must complete the sections and chapters of the course in sequence. The chapters are:
{: .showul}

- Chapter I: Understanding 7 Cups
- Chapter II: Operating as a listener
- Chapter III: Listening skills
- Chapter IV: Advanced skills

Each section ends with a quiz, and you must complete the quiz correctly before you can move on to the next section. Quiz questions can relate to the current section or to any previous section.

If you are not able to complete a quiz correctly, you can try again as many times as you need to. Each quiz is generated randomly, so that if you re-take a quiz the questions will not be exactly the same.

Once you have completed a section's quiz, you can go back and review the section whenever you want, without having to complete the quiz again.

You can work through this course at your own pace, and you can take as long as you want to complete it. You do not need to complete it in one session. You can stop at any time, and then at a later time return to pick up where you left off.

All the examples of chats in this course are fiction.

### Getting help

If you need help with any part of the course, or if you have questions, then you can ask in the forums at 7 Cups, ask any experienced listener, or message the author, [@RarelyCharlie](https://www.7cups.com/@RarelyCharlie "@RarelyCharlie on 7 Cups").

We'll begin the training by looking at what 7 Cups is&hellip;after you complete this quiz.
