In this fictional chat you shadow a listener called Morinda taking a general request.

Once the chat gets going, Morinda allows you to choose what to say to the member. The correct choice every time is the one that accurately reflects the member's feelings, even if their feelings are only implied. Any other choice is wrong.

You start the chat with 5 stars, but every time you choose wrongly you lose a star. If you lose all 5 stars the chat will end immediately.

- 0I There are several feelings there. Let's try to summarize all of them.
- 0Q Which reply accurately summarizes all the member's feelings?
  - 33 For sure! It's totally valid to feel the way you do right now, grades are very important and they can really stress us out! How do you usually cope with feel this kind of way before an exam?
  - 0 You're feeling unprepared for it, which means you're not certain how well you'll do, and the score in this exam can affect your final grades.
  - 26 You need to take your mind off the exam by doing some things you enjoy, things that will keep you calm tomorrow.
- 2M Yes you are right. I find it really hard to cope with it because a lot of thoughts keep going in mind and makes me anxious. Though I try to do some breathing, journaling, listening to music or self-talk.

  - 28 You're anxious that breathing, journaling, listening to music and self-talk might not work this time because Quantitative Economics is very tough.
- 2M Thank you for your encouragement. I appreciate it. I guess I will try them but not 100% sure how things will go. I guess it became part of every exam
- 0I There's still a feeling of uncertainty about every exam, so we need to reflect it.
- 0Q Which reply accurately reflects the member's feelings?

  - 24 You should feel proud that you've found several ways to cope! There's no need to let anxiety hold you back.
  - 0 You've used these techniques before because anxiety has become part of every exam, and it's still uncertain how tomorrow's will go. It's a tough one.
- 2M You're right, it's still uncertain and I'm still not feeling prepared, but I feel better after telling you about it.

7 Cups is designed for emotional support, but members often use the language of problem-solving to describe their situation, saying that they need help when really it's their state of mind that has brought them here.

Accurately reflecting people's feelings is what shows them they are being heard and understood. That's why reflection is at the heart of active listening.
