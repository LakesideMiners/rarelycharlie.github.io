A third way to be fully present in a chat is to react authentically to what the member tells you. To do this you have to be in touch with your own emotions and express how you genuinely feel in response to the member.

Member: *“Every time I try to explain to my mom she just ignores me. I've tried telling my dad but he just says discuss that with your mom. My friends are all obsessed by their own stuff. I had an appointment with a counselor but she just sat there going mmm-hmmm and looking at the clock.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“She was useless!”*
{: .conv}

It's important not to distance yourself from the member by making statements about yourself (I-statements), because these can come across as inauthentic and invalidate the emotions the member expressed. For example, if you say, “I think counselors who do that are useless” it's an I-statement, not an authentic reaction.

You can easily combine authentic reaction with conversation fillers. For example, “Really?” and “Oh no!” are fillers that also express reaction.

You can also combine reaction with reflection. For example:

Member: *“Something went wrong and I never saw her again.”*

Listener: *“Oh no! You lost her.”*

After the quiz, we'll look at being curious.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“For days after she told me I just couldn't concentrate on anything or achieve anything. It was almost like I wanted to cry. I just couldn't pick up the phone and call her. I don't know. Anyway, I had a contract the following week and I had to get on with my life,. I'm too busy for that kind of thing.”*
