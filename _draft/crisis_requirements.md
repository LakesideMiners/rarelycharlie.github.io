## Basic requirements

I think my requirements for an effective protocol are as follows. Let me know [in the forum](https://www.7cups.com/forum/ListenerLearningJourney_149/ForumDiscussionsDiscussionNotes_1848/Crisisprotocoloptionsandscenarios_198934/) if you think I'm wrong about any of these, or if there are other requirements, and I'll edit this list.

1. The protocol must clearly and unabiguously define which situations it applies to and which situations it does not apply to.

2. The protocol must clearly and unabiguously define the terminology it uses, and it must use terminology in a way that's consistent with general usage.

3. The protocol must not promote stigma.

4. The protocol must not risk causing harm by exacerbating known risk factors.

5. The protocol must not risk causing harm by counteracting known protective factors.

6. The protocol must apply internationally and to people of all cultures.

7. There must be good reason to expect the protocol to have an overall positive effect when compared to leaving things as they are without any new protocol.

## Listeners' options

I think the listener's options in each scenario are the following.

Let me know in the forum if you think I'm wrong about any of these, or if there are other options, and I'll edit this list. Some of them should perhaps be moved to the list of non-options, below.

These options are not meant to be exclusive. For example "A or D" could be an option, depending the listener's personal boundaries. Or "E then C" could be an option.

- **A** Continue the chat without conditions.

- **B** Block the conversation.

- **C** End the current chat but allow future chats.

- **D** Refer the chat to another listener.

- **E** Advise the member to call a volunteer suicide hotline in their country.

- **F** Advise the member to call a volunteer peer support warmline in their country.

- **G** Advise the member to call blue-light emergency services (police, fire, ambulance) in their country.

- **H** Advise the member to call a doctor or seek medical treatment in some other way.

- **I** Advise the member to call a mental health professional or go to a mental hospital.

- **J** Change the subject and continue chatting about something else.

- **K** Continue the chat if the member changes the subject themselves.

## Non-options

I assume the listener must never use any of the following non-options. Let me know in the forum if you think I'm wrong about any of these, or if there are other non-options, and I'll edit this list.

 - **X1** The listener calls their own emergency services.

 - **X2** The listener calls any other service local to the listener (for example, the listener's local suicide hotline).

 - **X3** Anything involving offsite contact details.

 - **X4** The listener tries to persuade the member not to take some action (for example, not to commit suicide).

 - **X5** The listener advises the member not to talk about the crisis (for example, not to talk about suicide).
