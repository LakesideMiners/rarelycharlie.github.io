To leave 7 Cups you do not need to anything special, unless you have entered into long term commitments. You can simply stop visiting the website or stop using the app. Optionally delete any bookmarks that go to 7 Cups, or delete the app.

There is more information below, depending on whether you have a guest, member, listener or therapist account.

## Guests

To cancel the guest account that 7 Cups generates automatically for you, delete the 7cups.com cookies and data from your browser, or delete the 7 Cups app.

How you delete cookies and data depends on your browser, and how you delete the app depends on your operating system, so this article cannot tell you those things.

## Members and listeners

If 7 Cups sends you mail, change your [Settings](https://www.7cups.com/member/editAccount.php) to stop any regular mail you receive. Optionally change your mail provider's settings to delete all mail from 7 Cups.

Optionally tell any communities you have been involved with that you are leaving. You could also put a message in your profile, and post to your feed.

### Deactivating your account

To deactivate your account, go to [Self-Care Break](https://www.7cups.com/member/deactivate.php). Although it's called "self-care break" you can use it to leave permanently.

Alternatively, go to your Settings page, scroll to the bottom, and click the Self-Care Break link there.

When your account is deactivated, your profile, feed, chats and profile image are not visible. Your screen name is mostly invisible (except that some people might have tagged you in forums, and the tags will still be visible).

Traces of you account persist for a short time in external search engines. This means that although people cannot find your profile on 7 Cups, for a short time after you leave they will still be able to find your profile by searching the Internet.

You can return to your deactivated account at any time and reactivate it.

### Permanently deactivating your account

To deactivate your account more permanently, so that you cannot ever reactivate it, first change your e-mail address and password to random strings that you will not be able to remember.

Here's a random e-mail address and password that you can copy and paste:

{% include rand-cred.html %}

After randomizing your e-mail address and password, save the changes. Then deactivate your account as described above.

### Deleting your account

7 Cups' terms of service imply that you can ask for your account to be deleted. It is not clear what this really means. If someone else ever reused your old screen name, there could be confusion in forums and elsewhere in the community, so it's possible that your screen name can never be deleted from the system.

If you want to ask for your account to be deleted anyway, you can try sending an e-mail request from the e-mail address that you used when you created the account, to: [community@7cups.com](mailto:community@7cups.com)

Mail sent to this address can take some days to get a response.

If that does not work, send a written and signed request by postal mail to:

7 Cups of Tea\\
1040 Camino Real South\\
Virginia Beach VA 23456-4204\\
USA

Use a delivery service that informs you when your request has been delivered. 

(The terms of service say you can fax the request, but no fax number is known.)

## Therapists

This article does not specifically cover therapist accounts in detail. If you are in the therapist directory, the first step is to remove your entry from the directory. Then proceed in a similar way to a member or listener account. For details, contact @LaraG.
