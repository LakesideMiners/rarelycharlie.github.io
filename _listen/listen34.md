When a member tells you a long story in a series of messages, reassure the member that you are still present by sending conversation fillers from time to time.

You do not need to respond to every message. Respond when there's a pause. If there's a longer pause, follow up by reflecting the story so far.

Member: *“I've never done this before.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“OK”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“I don't know what to say.”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“I don't think it will help”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“Oh.”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“I'm not the kind of person who can be helped.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“No?”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“Believe me, others have tried.”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“Two psychiatrists, four psychologists and three therapists have all”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“Have all tried?”*
{: .conv}

Member:  *“Yes. All of them had a go at me over the years.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“OK”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You don't think of yourself as someone who can be helped, because professionals have been trying for years.”*
{: .conv}

Fillers should be very short, preferably one or two words, like “OK”, “Yes.” or “Ah.” so that they do not disrupt the member's story.

After the quiz, we'll look at reacting authentically.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="True,False"}

*“It started when I was in my teens.”*
{: .conv}

*“Maybe 17? I'm not sure anymore.”*
{: .conv}

*“Well, there was a car crash.”*
{: .conv}

*“I wasn't hurt in any way.”*
{: .conv}
