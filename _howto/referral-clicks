You get referral clicks when someone comes to 7 Cups by seeing your personal link somewhere else and clicking on it.

To find your personal link, go to 7cups.com, log in, and look for the My Personal Link section, usually near the bottom right of the page. Copy the link and paste it where other people will see it. You can publish it anywhere you likeâ€”for example, on social media, and in e-mail and forum signatures.

Your personal link is exclusive to you but anonymous, so that no one can use it to discover your 7 Cups screen name.

In general, do not reveal your 7 Cups screen name outside 7 Cups, and do not reveal your real name, e-mail address or social media handles inside 7 Cups. (Slightly different rules apply to therapists, admins, and members of some teams.)
