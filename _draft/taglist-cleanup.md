To clean up any taglist, paste it here:

*TEXTAREA HERE*

Some web browsers do not detect the paste operation, so you might have to press the Clean up button.

**Notes:**

 - Each tag must begin with an @-sign. A word with no @-sign is ambiguous. For example, if the list contains `@Donald Duck` it is not possible to tell whether this is intended to be single tag, `@DonaldDuck`, or two tags, `@Donald @Duck`.
 
 - Extra characters are removed. For example, `@It'sTuesday!` becomes `@ItsTuesday`.
 
 - The resulting taglist is in alphabetical order.
