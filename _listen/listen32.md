An alternative to summarizing the whole of a long statement is to reflect just the last part. Reflecting the last part of a long statement creates continuity that helps to keep the conversation flowing, because the last part is the part that was in the member's mind as they finished typing.

Member: *“I've always been lonely, ever since I can remember. Even when I'm around other people I feel I'm not really there.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You're there but not really there.”*
{: .conv}

A disadvantage of reflecting just the last part is that it doesn't demonstrate to the member that you read the whole thing. There have to be frequent times in the conversation when you demonstrate that you understand what the member has told you.

With this in mind, it is up to you to judge which approach to reflection is best as the chat proceeds.

After the quiz, we'll look at being present in the conversation.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“My tutor says I have six weeks to make up my mind which option to choose. If I go for the one with all the math it's going to be much better for my career, which is important to me, but I find math really hard and my grades will probably be worse. I could go for the easier option but if it doesn't get me a job at the end of it what's the point? I really don't know what to do. It's been on my mind day and night.”*
