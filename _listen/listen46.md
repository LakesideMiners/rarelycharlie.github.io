Sometimes a member might say something that causes you to have a strong emotional reaction, so that you can no longer continue listening. This is sometimes called an emotional trigger.

Emotional triggers are very rare, even though they are often talked about. Don't assume that you'll be triggered just because a situation seems familiar or unpleasant. By remaining detached and reminding yourself that the member is a different person in a different situation, it's very likely that you'll be able to provide the member with effective emotional support in almost any situation.

If you find yourself being overwhelmed by thoughts or feelings during a chat, you can get help in the Listener Support Room. Discuss what to do with other listeners there. It's possible you can transfer the member to another listener. Do not talk about yourself to the member.

Member: *“Then yesterday we were told she has a brain tumor. I've been so confused by my thoughts all night that I haven't even been able to go and see her. I feel like my whole world has just been switched off.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You feel devastated by that terrible news.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *”Unfortunately I'm not able to continue this chat, but I've found another listener who can take over from me immediately and continue to chat to you. Is that OK?”*
{: .conv}

Having thoughts and feelings about a member's situation after the chat has ended shows you established a strong human connection in the chat. Give yourself time to think things through and for the thoughts and feelings to subside. Consider chatting with a mentor if you have any thoughts or feelings you can't make sense of. If thoughts and feelings persist for a long time and interfere with your life in any way, take a break from listening and use your member account to get support from other listeners.

After the quiz, we'll look at personal boundaries.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“When he touched me like that I just froze.”*
{: .conv}

*“I mean I didn't just keep very still. My mind went completely empty”*
{: .conv}

*“I just like went on autopilot. I can't even remember what happened next.”*
{: .conv}

*“Is that normal?”*
{: .conv}
