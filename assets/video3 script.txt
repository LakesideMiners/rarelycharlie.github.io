	T02: "an unofficial simulated chat on 7 Cups",	
	
	A01: "C Hello everybody! I'm Citri, a new listener on 7 Cups. It's good to have you with me here this morning as I chat with John, a member. John just messaged me and I'm not sure how to respond. But my cat, Bleu, knows all about how things work at 7 Cups, and she's going to help me. Bleu? Bleu? Are you there?",
	
	S01: "M0 Hey, I'm John. Can you help me? I need some advice.",
	
	A02: "B Yes, I'm here!",

	A03: "C What can I say to John? I know we're not allowed to give advice.",
	
	A04: "B You're right. Listeners are not allowed to give advice. But John didn't say give. He said need. Is it OK for him to need advice, do you think?",
	
	A05: "C Yes, I think I get it. It's OK for him to need advice.",
	
	A06: "B So you can tell him it's OK, right?",
	
	A07: "C Right! I'll tell him.",
	
	A08: "B And make sure you repeat some of his exact words, to prove you read what he wrote.",
	
	A09: "C Right, I'll do that too.",
	
	S02: "L1 You need advice. That's OK :)",
	
	A10: "B Good. The smiley was a nice touch! And do you think you can help him?",
	
	A11: "C I'm not sure. Maybe.",
	
	A12: "B So you could say that too.",
	
	A13: "C OK",
	
	S03: "L0 Maybe I can help you, John. I'm not sure.",
	
	A14: "B I like the way you repeated his name there, too. Let's wait and see what he says.",
	
	A15: "C No response and it's been two minutes. What do I do now?",
	
	A16: "B Maybe ask a question? Questions beginning with 'what' or 'how' are good. Open questions, they're called.",
	
	A17: "OK",
	
	S04: "What do you need advice about?",
	
	A18: "B That was good. I liked the way you repeated John's words 'need' and 'advice'.",
	
	S05: "M3 I've done a terrible thing. I feel so bad about it. What can I do?",
	
	A19: "C I've no idea what he can do! What can I possibly say?",
	
	A20: "B Well, what do you want to say to him?",
	
	A21: "C I want to tell him whatever he did can't have been so terrible and he shouldn't feel bad.",
	
	A22: "B You want to deny the validity of everything he just told you? That would be a really bad idea! How about you just confirm that you read what John just wrote, without trying to fix it?",
	
	A23: "C Just confirm that I read it, and nothing else?",
	
	A24: "B Yes, just confirm that you read it, and nothing else.",
	
	S06: "L1 You did a terrible thing and you feel bad about it. You're wondering what to do now.",
	
	S07: "M1 Yeah.",
	
	A25: "B So now you can ask an open question again.",
	
	S08: "L1 What was the terrible thing you did?",
	
	A26: "C Was that OK?",
	
	A27: "B That was perfect. You started with 'what' and you repeated John's exact words again.",
	
	A28: "C But John hasn't replied and it's been two minutes again. This feels really uncomfortable.",
	
	A29: "B Maybe it's too difficult for him to answer right now. When that happens it can be worth trying a closed question so he can simply answer 'yes' or 'no'. But be careful not to change the subject just because you feel uncomfortable.",
	
	S09: "L3 Are you able to tell me about what you did?",
	
	A30: "C How was that?",
	
	A31: "B That was perfect again. Your closed question makes it easy for him to reply.",
	
	S10: "M2 I'm too ashamed.",
	
	A32: "C Can I tell him not to feel ashamed? Or I'm proud of him for opening up? I suppose I can't say things like that.",
	
	A33: "B You're getting the idea. Don't invalidate John's feeling of shame, and don't change the subject to avoid it.",
	
	S11: "L1 It makes you ashamed to think you did it.",
	
	A34: "Good reflection! Showing you read and understood what John wrote, and you're managing your own discomfort so it doesn't interfere with John's chat.",
	
	S12: "M1 Yeah. It's not like me to do anything like that. I'm normally",
	
	S13: "M1 Normally very careful about what I say.",
	
	A35: "C I'm thinking the terrible thing John did was something he said.",
	
	A36: "B I agree. You could tell him exactly that.",
	
	S14: "L1 I'm thinking the terrible thing you did was something you said.",
	
	S15: "M1 Yeah. My mom had a total meltdown.",
