Listening in an online chat is a skill.

It is not enough to read what the member said. You must demonstrate that you have read and understood by repeating in your reply the most important parts of what the member said.

This is sometimes called reflection, because it's like showing the member a reflection in a mirror. The goal is to demonstrate to the member that they have been heard.

The simplest form of reflection is when the member makes a simple statement and you use exactly the same words, or almost the same, in your reply. Do not make comments or assumptions, Do not ask questions. Do not change the subject. The goal is simply to demonstrate that you heard. This is the very heart of active listening.

Listener: *“What brings you to 7 Cups today?”*
{: .conv}

Member: *“I am sad.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“Your sadness brought you here today.”*
{: .conv}

Reflection seems strange and difficult to many people because it is not like normal conversation. Active listening is not normal conversation. It is specially designed to provide emotional support.

After the quiz, we'll look at how to deal with longer statements that members may make, and also at more ways to reflect what a member tells you.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“I am angry with my brother. So very angry.”*
{: .conv}

Which of the following could be appropriate replies?
