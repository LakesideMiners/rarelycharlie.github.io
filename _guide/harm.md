# Preface
This document is a rough draft version of an unofficial training guide for listeners about chats involving harm. It is not a self-help guide for members.

In this draft version there are no page breaks. In the final version each section will be on a separate page. Readers will mostly have to answer a quiz correctly in order to move to the next page.<a href="0"></a>

# Part I
General information for all listeners.

# What this guide is for
This guide provides information for listeners on chatting with members who talk about harm.

**Trigger warning:** Part I of this guide is intended to provide general information for all listeners. Part II contains examples that some listeners may find upsetting or triggering. 

If you feel there is a possibility that you might be upset or triggered by reading about examples of harm, then you might want to consider stopping when you reach the end of Part I. There is a title page at the beginning of Part II that repeats this trigger warning.

Harm includes harm in the past and present, and risk of harm in the future. It includes harm to members themselves and to others, also including harm to vulnerable people such as children, and harm that is a criminal offense.

The goals of this guide are to help ensure that, in the context of harm or risk of harm:
- Listeners understand the purpose and limitations of 7 Cups.
- Listeners understand how to care for themselves.
- Listeners do not mistakenly give a "green light" to behaviors that cause harm.
- Listeners have an understanding of the reasons some members may talk about harm.
- Listeners can continue to apply the principles of active listening effectively when members talk about harm.

There are links to further information and to public resources that you can share with members.
