The Taglist Service here provides an easy way to create auto-updating taglists for 7 Cups.

You don't need a Google account or any special privilege at 7 Cups. There is no possibility of offsite contact.

<b style="letter-spacing: .8px;">Warning:</b> This service is currently experimental. If there are unforeseen problems it could be suspended temporarily or withdrawn permanently. If this is ever necessary, taglist owners will be notified that their taglists are no longer auto-updating.

To create a new taglist using this service, click here: [Create Taglist](/taglist). Follow the instructions.

### How it works

Each taglist is controlled by a public thread in a 7 Cups forum. This thread is the taglist's control thread. The person who creates the control thread (the original poster) owns the taglist.

To add yourself to any taglist, go to its control thread in the forums, press the Post to Thread button at the top and write *the exact words* "Please add me."

To remove yourself from any taglist, go to its control thread in the forums, press the Post to Thread button at the top and write *the exact words* "Please remove me."

The taglist uses these phrases to auto-update.

### For owners of taglists
	
If you are the owner of a taglist you can give some other commands in its control thread in the forums. Press the Post to Thread button to give a command. Tags must start with @, and if you include more than one tag they must be separated by spaces, in the usual way.

 - "Please add: " followed by one or more tags `*`
 - "Please remove: " followed by one or more tags
 - "Please remove everyone."
 
`*` When adding a lot of tags, take care to ensure that they are all correct. The service does not validate them. Extra spaces, other unexpected characters, or missing @-signs can prevent the update from being processed in the way you expect.

For any other maintenance requirements, to suggest a new feature, or to report a problem, please send a message (PM) to [@RarelyCharlie](https://www.7cups.com/@RarelyCharlie).

**Notes:**
 - Only public control threads are supported. Control threads in private areas of the forums do not work. (For example, control threads in the listener and therapist areas do not work.)
 
 - When a taglist owner adds tags, there is no check that the tags are valid. (But when someone adds themselves, the tag is guaranteed to be valid at that time.)
