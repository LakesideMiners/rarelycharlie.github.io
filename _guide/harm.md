# *Preface*
*This document is a rough draft version of an unofficial training guide for listeners about chats involving harm. It is not a self-help guide for members.*

*In this draft version there are no page breaks. In the final version each section will be on a separate page. Readers will mostly have to answer a quiz correctly in order to move to the next page.*

# Part I
General information for all listeners.

# What this guide is for
This guide provides information and guidance for those listeners who are willing to chat with with members who talk about harm.

**Trigger warning:** Part I of this guide is intended to provide general information for all listeners. Part II contains examples that some listeners may find upsetting or triggering. 

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

If you feel there is a possibility that you might be upset or triggered by reading about examples of harm, then you might want to consider stopping when you reach the end of Part I. There is a title page at the beginning of Part II that repeats this trigger warning.

Harm includes harm in the past and present, and risk of harm in the future. It includes harm to members themselves and to others, also including harm to vulnerable people such as children, and harm that is a criminal offense.

The goals of this guide are to help ensure that, in the context of harm or risk of harm:
- Listeners understand the purpose and limitations of 7 Cups.
- Listeners understand how to care for themselves.
- Listeners do not mistakenly give a "green light" to behaviors that cause harm.
- Listeners have an understanding of the reasons some members may talk about harm.
- Listeners can continue to apply the principles of active listening effectively when members talk about harm.

There are links to further information and to public resources that you can share with members.

Everywhere this guide uses the word "members", the information also applies to guests.

# The purpose of 7 Cups

7 Cups exists because there is an unmet need in the world for emotional support:

> **Our Goal:** We are living in a world with an immense love deficit, which means that none of us is receiving the love we need to reach our true potential, to truly thrive. Our goal is to build a support system, a web, that can hold every member of our world.  We believe that we can fill that love-gap for every person in the world, either because they are an active member of our community or because they are touched personally by someone who has been empowered by 7 Cups of Tea.
	
from [Our Mission](https://www.7cups.com/forum/GlensNook_84/OurVisionforaBetterWorld_334/OurMission_18219/1/)
{:.right}

7 Cups has values that describe how we relate to people. They have since been simplified, but our original values included:

> We do not judge or look down on people. We recognize that people make sense in the larger context or story of their lives. Sometimes it can seem like people are making choices that do not make sense, but this is likely because we do not have all of the details. We understand that people are complicated and that life is not simple or easy.

{:.right}

### Limitations

However, 7 Cups imposes general limitations on the emotional support its listeners provide. If a member is actively harming themselves or someone else, you cannot continue the chat. You have no say in the matter. This is 7 Cups policy.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decol}

It is important to be aware that the word "actively" means "taking action". A thought or fantasy is not an action. Planning to take action is not the same as taking action.

For example, someone might have thoughts about making carrot soup. They might clearly imagine the recipe or know exactly where to find it. But these things are not the same as buying the carrots, peeling them and chopping them. There's an essential difference between thoughts and actions.

### Distinguishing thoughts from actions

Some people find the distinction between thoughts and actions obvious, and some people find it difficult. There's a recognised cognitive impairment called thought-action fusion that makes it difficult for people to distinguish between thoughts and actions easily, and if you suffer from it even slightly you might have to think more carefully than most people when trying to decide whether something is a thought or an action. There's more about thought-action fusion in a later section.

### Outside help

Listeners can sometimes provide members with factual information about sources of help outside 7 Cups, but there are reasons to be careful about doing this. For example, providing information can undermine the real purpose of 7 Cups. There will be more about this, too, later in the guide.

There are some reminders about exactly how listeners at 7 Cups go about providing emotional support later in this guide.

# Self care

7 Cups very strongly encourages you to care for yourself as a priority at all times.

### Boundaries

You should think about your personal boundaries, and make decisions in advance about the kinds of chats you are personally willing to take.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

You have to make these decisions in advance, as far as possible, because a chat that starts out being about one subject can very quickly change to some other subject. You will need to be able to take action to protect yourself immediately there's a change of subject that goes beyond your personal boundaries.

If you haven't already done so, take a few minutes right now to list the topics of conversation that lie outside your personal boundaries. You could write the list in your [Notes](https://www.7cups.com/notes.php). (The link provided here works for any listener, provided you are logged in to 7 Cups.) Check your list from time to time to remind yourself of it, and also to keep it updated.

It's also OK to be willing to chat about any topic without restriction. In this case you don't need any list. But you should still make the decision not to have any list thoughtfully and in advance.

### When your boundaries are crossed

When a chat goes beyond your personal boundaries, consider handing it over to another listener who has different boundaries. You need the member's consent and also the other listener's consent for this.

1. Tell the member that you are unable to chat about this subject.
2. Tell the member that another listener might be available.
3. If the member agrees, go to the Listener Support Room (the question mark button <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1.2em; height: 1.2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #555; border-radius: .6em; color: #555; font-weight: bold;">?</span> at the top right of the chat.
4. In five words or less, tell the room why you need to hand over the chat. Do not share more details of the chat.
5. When you have identified another listener, provide the member with a link to the other listener's profile. In a chat this looks like `7cups.com/@NameOfListener`
6. Tell the member to press the Leave Message or Chat Now button in the listener's profile.
7. End the chat.
8. Do not discuss the member with the other listener at any time.

If the member does not agree at step 3, tell the member that you have to end the chat, and end the chat.

If you cannot find any other listener at step 5, ask the member to message a suitable listener from the Browse Listeners page. Provide the link: `7cups.com/BrowseListeners` Explain that the page has a More Filters button at the top, which is useful for finding appropriate listeners.

There is normally no need to block the member. They might want to chat with you about some other topic in the future.

At any stage in all this, allow the member to continue the chat and avoid the problematic subject if that's what they prefer. Some members value the relationship they have established with you more than the precise subject of the conversation.

### After a difficult chat

After a chat that oversteps your personal boundaries, consider chatting to a peer supporter or a mentor about your own feelings. This is particularly important if your feelings persist or if you find yourself thinking about the chat long afterwards.

If a chat affects you emotionally, and this in turn affects your real-life relationships or your ability to live your life normally, do not hesitate to switch to your member account and chat with an experienced listener about what happened and how it affected you.

If you have a therapist or someone else in the real world you rely on for emotional support, be open with them about the effect volunteering as a listener at 7 Cups has on you, but do not share any details of any chat.

# Brief active listening refresher

This guide assumes you are still familiar with the initial listener training. Here's a selection of exact quotes as reminders:

- "Keep in mind that active listening is not counseling or advice giving."
- "You shouldn’t try to solve their problems."
- "Repeat back to the person the facts that they have just shared."
- "Don’t add questions, commentary, or suggestions."
- "Repeat back expressed emotions."
- "Avoid making assumptions."
- "It is important to not break confidentiality."
- "Don’t hesitate to refer the person if they have needs that extend beyond listening."
- "The primary reason we allow anonymity is because it allows people to seek help without fear of being judged."
- "Being triggered is a normal part of life."
- "Report inappropriate behavior."

If any of these seem unfamiliar, take a few minutes right now to review the [Active Listening](https://www.7cups.com/listener/training/) guide before returning to this guide.

### Emotional support

The way listeners at 7 Cups provide emotional support is through active listening, allowing people to feel heard. Emotional support has a particular focus on feelings. The goal is to allow people to express their feelings and to know that their feelings have been heard.

Realistically, life is not simple or easy. People have both positive and negative emotions in response to the events of their lives. Listeners should allow both the positive emotions and the negative emotions to be heard equally.

In response to situations involving harm, people naturally have negative emotions. Listeners at 7 Cups allow people's negative emotions to be heard.

Do not try to suppress members' negative emotions or supply positive emotions. If you do that, you might neutralize a member's natural negative emotions in response to harm, allowing the harm to continue.

For example, if a member tells you they are worried about causing harm, repeat back the worry they have expressed, just like the listener training says. Do not neutralize the worry or change the subject to something positive—doing that risks giving a "green light" to the harm.

Similarly, if a member tells you they are worried about being harmed, repeat back the worry they have expressed, just like the listener training says. Do not neutralize the worry or change the subject to something positive—doing that risks perpetuating the harm they are suffering.

QUIZ

# Why members talk about harm

Members talk about harm for a variety of reasons. They might be the person causing the harm, or they might be the person harmed, or they might be both.

Part II of this guide looks at examples of several reasons members might talk about harm. They are not necessarily the only reasons, but they illustrate the kinds of situations that members often find themselves in. For the purposes of this guide, the reasons fall into three broad groups.

### Mental disorders

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

Members who suffer from mental disorders are the first group. Mental disorders are, roughly speaking, disturbances in thinking, emotions and relationships that don't have an identifiable physical cause. An example is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

When members with mental disorders talk about harm, the harm might not necessarily be real. This is because mental disorders can cause disturbances in thinking, and in some cases the disturbances are very severe. Members might be unaware that they have a mental disorder, or unaware of its precise effects.

### Neurological disorders

Members who suffer from certain neurological disorders are the second group. Neurological disorders are, roughly speaking, disturbances in perception, thinking and relationships that are thought to have a physical cause in the nervous system (which includes the brain). For the purpose of this guide the relevant neurological disorders can be thought of as brain damage.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decol}

When members with neurological disorders talk about harm, the harm might not necessarily be real. This is because neurological disorders can also cause disturbances in thinking, and in some cases the disturbances are very severe. Members might be unaware that they have a neurological disorder, or unaware of its precise effects.

### Fantasy and truth

Members who are fantasizing or telling the truth are the third group. Fantasy and truth are grouped together here because in each case the member knows what is true and what is false, but the listener doesn't. These members do not have any relevant medical disorder affecting their thinking. Some of these members might mix fantasy and truth in the same chat.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

All of this means that no matter what the member's reason for talking about harm might be, a listener cannot rely on the harm being real. Equally, a listener cannot rely on the harm being false.

In some chats members do talk about real harm or real risk of future harm. In some chats members talk about fears and fantasies. In some chats members are not able to distinguish between what is real, what is fear, and what is a fantasy. And in some chats parts of all three are mixed together.

### Your key skill

As a listener, you cannot diagnose any medical disorder. It's easy to do the right thing: simply do not try to diagnose, and do not imagine that you can.

As a listener, you cannot judge what is real, what is a member's fear and what is a member's fantasy. It's difficult to do the right thing. Your key skill as a listener is accurately reflecting the emotions that a member expresses, without attempting to judge the facts.

QUIZ
{:.dummyquiz}

# Thoughts and actions

Thought-action fusion (TAF) is a cognitive impairment (a thinking problem) that affects many people in the population, both members and listeners. It causes thoughts to be confused with reality to some degree or other.

For example, someone affected by TAF might believe thinking about a car crash before driving to work makes it more likely they will crash the car. Or they might believe mentioning the word cancer could make someone they care about more likely to develop cancer.

Mostly, TAF is mild. When TAF causes significant distress it can easily be treated by a mental health professional.

### Members

When members are affected by TAF, it can make them genuinely believe they are causing harm, or at risk of causing harm, when the reality is they only have thoughts about imaginary harm.

In severe cases this is symptomatic of a mental disorder, a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There is more information about OCD in Part II of this guide. Listeners cannot diagnose or treat any mental disorder. Even if a member experiences TAF mildly, a listener cannot try to solve the problem.

When a member describes significant distress because of TAF, a listener cannot give advice or suggest how to solve the problem, but a listener can state a simple fact, like:

*Member:* This is eating up my whole life. I virtually can't get in the car because I spend so much time worrying that I've killed someone.
{:.chat}

*Listener:* That's the kind of thing a professional can help with.
{:.chat}

### Listeners

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

When listeners are affected by TAF, it can make them genuinely believe that a member who wants to talk about thoughts of harm is causing real harm, or is at risk of causing real harm.

In more severe cases, a member doesn't mention harm at all but the listener imagines harm. Then the listener's TAF makes the imaginary harm seem real. This could make the listener say inappropriate things to the member.

For example:

*Member:* Since we broke up I've been feeling sad. When I was younger I would have harmed myself at times like this.
{:.chat}

(The listener imagines the member feeling so sad that she attempts suicide. TAF makes the listener think the member is really at risk of attempting suicide.)

*Listener:* You should see a counselor and call a suicide helpline.
{:.chat.warn}

Do not give members advice in this way, especially when it is based on your own imagination. Instead, repeat back the member's feelings accurately:

*Listener:* The breakup has caused you sadness, but it's not like when you were younger.
{:.chat.ok}

If you are aware that you experience TAF to some extent, take particular care to distinguish carefully between your own thoughts and reality that can be verified.

QUIZ
{:.dummyquiz}

# Unintended consequences

If listeners do not stick closely to the techniques described in the initial listener training, they risk unintended consequences for members who have certain memory impairments.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decol}

Memory impairments are universal in the general population. They affect members and listeners. For the purposes of this guide, the significant memory impairments are the ones that affect members.

These memory impairments are often associated with brain injury. For example, a member might have suffered a blow to the head in an accident, causing brain injury. Or the member's mother might have drunk excessive alcohol while she was pregnant, causing damage to the member's brain (fetal alcohol syndrome).

Similar effects are also associated with mental disorders that involve psychosis. A member who experiences psychosis may find it difficult to distinguish between reality and imagination, so if you suggest something and they imagine it, they might start to think it's real.

### Suggestibility

Suggestibility causes people to incorporate information that they see or hear into their own thinking. For example, a member has a red car:

*Member:* I love my car!
{:.chat}

*Listener:* That's great! Is it a white car?
{:.chat.warn}

(At this point the member imagines a white car, because that's what the listener suggested. Now the member cannot remember what color their car really is, because their memory impairment allows the image of a white car to dominate.)

*Member:* Yes, I love my white car!
{:.chat}
	
Listeners must not sneak suggestions into chats, because some members are vulnerable to suggestion. Of course, if it's just the color of a car it's not very important. If the chat is about some form of harm it can be very important.

*Listener:* Your car makes you feel good ![:)](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/smile.png)
{:.chat.ok}

### Confabulation

Confabulation causes people to invent information that fills gaps in their memory. People who confabulate may invent different information at different times, making them tell you inconsistent things.

For example, a member who has a memory impairment is distressed because her father is becoming frail in old age:

*Member:* It makes me so unhappy that he isn't able do as much for himself as he used to.
{:.chat}

(The listener imagines the member is unhappy because she has to do the things her father can't do.)

*Listener:* It's not fair. What ways have you tried to get him to do his share?
{:.chat.warn}

(Now the member imagines herself trying to get her father to do his share, even though that's just the listener's fantasy.)

*Member:* I shout at him.
{:.chat}

(But this is not true. She feels sorry for him and never shouts at him. The listener's leading question, combined with her memory impairment, caused her to confabulate.)

Remember to reflect the things members tell you accurately:

*Listener:* You're sad because he can't do things for himself so much now.
{:.chat.ok}

### Avoiding unintended consequences

To avoid unintended consequences, be very careful not to introduce new ideas from your own imagination into member's chats. This is particularly important when there is possible harm, or risk of harm.

# Mental disorders and harm—I

This section and the next look at six categories of mental disorder that can be associated with chats about harm. This is just an overview. There are further examples in Part II because the details might be upsetting or triggering to some listeners. First, depression, OCD and PTSD.

### Depression

Depression is a very common emotional disorder. It affects how people feel about themselves and about life, making them unable to imagine the future in a positive and hopeful way. In a severe case, a depressed person might not be able to imagine tomorrow.

When depression is associated with harm, it's usually about the depressed person causing real or imaginary harm to themselves. They come to 7 Cups and talk about the harm they have caused or feel they might cause.

Do not let your imagination make you think a member is at risk of harming themselves when in reality they have a disorder that makes it difficult for them to imagine the future, and they want their feelings to be heard.

### OCD

OCD is obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is usually considered to be a thought disorder. It affects how people think about certain risks, different risks for each OCD sufferer. In a typical case, a person has uncontrollable thoughts (obsessions) about some risk, combined with thought-action fusion (TAF, described in a previous section of this guide).

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decol}

The thought disorder makes them confuse thoughts about risk with real risk. So they behave in ways (compulsions) that they think will reduce the risk and keep them safe. But although the behaviors do reduce real risk, they have no effect on the obsessive thoughts, and a cycle of thoughts and compulsions is the result. 

When OCD is associated with harm, it's usually because the OCD sufferer has thoughts about some risk of harm to themselves or others. The thought disorder makes them confuse thoughts about risk with real risk. They come to 7 Cups and talk about what they consider to be real risks of harm.

Do not let your imagination make you think a member is at risk of causing harm when in reality they have a disorder that makes them compulsively avoid causing harm, and they need their feelings about it to be heard.

### PTSD

Post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, is a disorder affecting perceptions, thoughts and feelings. It is the result of actual harm (trauma) in the past. There might be continuing risk of real harm in the present and the future, and there might be continuing fears about possible harm in the present and the future whether or not there is real risk.

PTSD sufferers can experience a very wide range of symptoms and difficulties, especially if the PTSD is the result of multiple traumas or a persistent period of trauma.

Not all PTSD sufferers are aware that they suffer from PTSD, and the diagnosis sometimes emerges during therapy for some other condition, such as depression or OCD. However, not all people who experience events that seem like they might be traumatic ever develop PTSD at all.

Do not make assumptions about whether or not a member has PTSD, and do not either reinforce or challenge a member's own thoughts about whether or not they have PTSD. Listeners should not get involved in diagnosis.

In all cases when a member might have a mental disorder, you cannot be sure whether they have a disorder or not, and if they do have a disorder you cannot be sure what it is. Ensure that you accurately reflect members' feelings without judging them, either positively or negatively, and without diagnosing.

QUIZ
{:.dummyquiz}

# Mental disorders and harm—II

This section continues the previous section, looking at three more types of mental disorder that can be associated with chats about harm: psychosis, personality disorders, and paraphilic disorder.

### Psychosis

Psychosis is a disorder in the way people keep track of reality. It makes telling the difference between reality and imagination more difficult, or in severe cases impossible. Many of us have had the experience of waking from a dream and not being sure, for a moment, whether we are awake or this is still the dream. Psychosis is like that but all the time, or all the time on and off. And very often the dream is a nightmare.

When psychosis is associated with harm, it's usually because the psychosis sufferer imagines doing harm or being harmed but genuinely thinks it's real, or isn't sure. The harm might be in the past, present or future.

People who suffer from psychosis might come to 7 Cups to talk about the harm they have caused or might cause. It's sometimes because they feel guilt, or fear criminal liability, and sometimes because they are trying to work out whether the harm in their thoughts is real.

Do not let your imagination make you think a member is doing harm or is being harmed, when in reality they have a disorder that makes them unsure what's real, and they want their fears to be heard.

At the same time, people who suffer from psychosis sometimes do cause harm, or are harmed by others. Sometimes what they fear is real. At 7 Cups what we provide is for their fears to be heard, whether real or not.

### Personality disorders

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

Personality disorders are effectively disorders of relationships. People who suffer from these disorders think and behave in unusual and ineffective or harmful ways towards other people. There is a wide range of personality disorders, and although current classifications do group them in categories, there isn't complete agreement on whether the categories are all that useful.

When personality disorders are associated with harm, it might be because the sufferer causes harm to others without being fully aware of how harmful it is. Or it might be because the sufferer causes harm to themselves. Or it might be because other people cause harm to the sufferer in retaliation for the way the sufferer treats them.

Harm described by people with personality disorders might often be real, but as a listener you have no way to be sure. As usual, ensure that members' feelings are heard and that you reflect them accurately without adding thoughts of your own. 

### Paraphilic disorder

Paraphilic disorder is a disorder of sexuality. It affects sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors (but not necessarily all three in the same person). When paraphilic disorder is mild, and the sufferer is able to live a normal life, it is known as paraphilia (not a mental disorder). When paraphilia involves children as the target, it is known as pedophilia.

When these disorders do affect behaviors they are often associated with criminal acts. However, the association between paraphilia and criminality is not all that strong. For example, most people convicted of sexual crimes do not suffer from this kind of disorder (although they might or might not suffer from other disorders).

When paraphilic disorder is associated with harm, it might be fantasy or actual harm. Listeners are unable to judge what is fantasy and what is actual harm.

People with paraphilic disorder might come to 7 Cups to talk about their fantasies, urges or behaviors. Listeners cannot make the judgement that fantasies and urges will result in behaviors.

Many listeners choose not to take chats that deal with sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors. If you do choose to take these chats, avoid positive judgements and also avoid negative judgements. Ensure that members who express their emotions are heard, and that their emotions are accurately reflected.

Remember that in all cases when a member might have a mental disorder, you cannot be sure whether they have a disorder or not, and if they do have a disorder you cannot be sure what it is. Ensure that you accurately reflect members' feelings without judging them, either positively or negatively, and without diagnosing.

QUIZ
{:.dummyquiz}

# Fantasies and actual harm

Members sometimes describe harmful events that might be fantasies or truth, or some mixture of fantasies and truth. Listeners are usually unable to judge what is the truth and what isn't.

Sometimes, however, very outrageous fantasies are obviously fantasies. Sometimes fantasies are based on well-known works of fiction, such as movies and TV shows, and these might sometimes be obvious to listeners.

### Reasons for sharing fantasies

Members' reasons for sharing fantasies are not usually clear. One reason might sometimes be loneliness and lack of self-worth, because they feel a fantasy about harm is sure to get attention but if they are just themselves no one would want to chat to them.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

Sometimes fantasies contain elements of truth. The situation might be that a member feels the truth difficult to talk about, so they talk about a fantasy first, and then mix in parts of the thing they really want to talk about. So at the start the chat can feel very uncomfortable because you feel you're just being told a fantasy, but if you stay with it sometimes you end up in a very real chat about something the member finds difficult.

Another reason members sometimes chat about fantasies of harm is as a deliberate hoax, maybe to overcome feelings of inferiority.

And another reason is to test 7 Cups to see whether they are believed and accepted when they mention something shocking like harm. If 7 Cups passes the test, and they are believed and accepted, then they might return using a different identity to chat about what's really troubling them.

### Reasons for sharing the truth

Members who are really causing harm, or at risk of causing harm, might chat to a listener about it hoping to get advice on how bad it really is and how guilty they should feel.

You don't have any way to distinguish between the member who is telling a lie to test how judgemental 7 Cups is, and the member who is telling the truth to find out how guilty they should feel. Your only option, therefore, is to believe and accept the person without giving the "green light" to possible harmful behavior.

Members who are really causing harm, or at risk of causing harm, are very likely not to admit to it at all. They chat about something else entirely. Do not change the subject of any chat to satisfy your curiosity about whether a member might be causing harm but not telling you.

QUIZ
{:.dummyquiz}

# External resources

It is sometimes appropriate to provide a member with a link to a resource outside 7 Cups.

The best way for this to happen is if they can search the Internet themselves for a helpline or website that is local to them and specific to their needs. There are thousands of services globally, and no central directory other than Internet search. 

Listeners at 7 Cups are not required to provide Internet search services to members, no matter what the circumstances are.

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decor}

Do not provide any external resource link to a member unless they have clearly indicated their need for it. In particular, do not provide a resource link based on something you yourself said to the member earlier in the chat, or something in your imagination.

Members who have known medical conditions often have their own information about local resources they can access. Do not provide international or national resources to members who have access to more appropriate local services.

Helpline numbers found on the Internet are often out of date or operate restricted hours. Finding a helpline number does not mean the member can get help there.

While a member contacts an external resource, offer to keep the chat open, if possible. Offer to chat again later to provide emotional support (but not to chat about a topic that lies outside your boundaries).

Do not contact external resources yourself on behalf of a member.

### Countries

DECORATIVE IMAGE
{:.decol}

People from all over the world use 7 Cups. The top three countries in terms of visitors per month are the US, India and the UK. About 40% of visitors are from other countries.

Before you provide a national resource link, ask the member what country they are in. Ask carefully, because this question might make a member suspicious you are trying to trace them.

Do not give a member a resource link in the wrong country. In particular, do not provide a resource link in your own country to a member who might be in some other country.

### Mandatory reporting

Some organizations and some legal jurisdictions require certain people to report certain crimes to the authorities if they come across evidence or have suspicion of them.

7 Cups does not have any mandatory reporting.

In theory, your local laws might make reporting mandatory in some situations, but 7 Cups is not aware of any legal jurisdiction that has mandatory reporting for 7 Cups listeners.

If you think your local laws do make reporting mandatory, check with a local lawyer or legal advice service to establish whether it applies to listening at 7 Cups. Note that at 7 Cups you have no information about who any member is or where on the planet they are.

If you are a member of a professional body, the body might have a mandatory reporting requirement. Check with the body's legal department whether the requirement applies when you are a volunteer at 7 Cups, not working in any professional capacity, and not in contact with identifiable individuals.

If you can establish beyond doubt, based on written evidence, that you are subject to a mandatory reporting requirement, tell 7 Cups by e-mail, from the address you used to sign up as a listener, to `community@7cups.com`.
