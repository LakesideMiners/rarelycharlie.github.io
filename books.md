# Listening and related techniques

Listening in the wider context of techniques that help people. Rogers (1942) is the most important book in this entire list.

#### Carl R. Rogers (1942) _Counseling and Psychotherapy: Newer Concepts in Practice_

A book about what we now call active listening, explaining where the idea of active listening originally came from, how it helps people, and how to do it. Full of real examples transcribed from recorded sessions. 

If you're a listener, or thinking of becoming a listener, and if you only read one book from the list, I recommend that this should be the one (the first half of it, anyway).

#### Kay Redfield Jamison (1997) _An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness_

A first-hand account of living with bipolar disorder, by a renowned clinical psychologist, now a professor of psychiatry.

# Psychotherapy

The techniques of psychotherapy, which mostly include active listening but go a long way beyond active listening.

#### Judith Beck (1995) _Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond_

A textbook by the daughter of CBT's originator, Aaron T. Beck, showing how very different therapy with a professional therapist is from active listening (even though it includers active listening), and also why particular therapy techniques taken out of context do not amount to therapy.

#### Irvin D. Yalom (2009) _The Gift of Therapy_

This _Open Letter to a New Generation of Therapists and their Patients_ provides a fascinating insight into the mind of a very experienced therapist. It shows how psychotherapy (mostly long-term existential therapy and group therapy) builds on the very basic techniques of active listening.

In 85 short chapters, with little jargon and many anecdotes and quotes.
