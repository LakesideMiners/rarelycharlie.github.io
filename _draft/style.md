# Question 1

 I was just getting into my car and she ran out of the house screaming at me. You know I dont want the whole neighborhood to hear these things. I know exactly how people will gossip and make fake news out of it. I have self respect you know! I just had to shut her up or get her indoors somehow and thats when it happened.

 - 42 That must feel terrible! You can get help with a wide range of issues in our Q&A section. Simply search for the issue that most closely matches your current situation.
 - 20 You were going to get into your car, but you had to shut her up or get her indoors first.
 - 13 I am always very aware of what people might be saying about me. I think it's so important these days because of all the gossip on social media.
 - 01 Your self respect was obviously at risk in that situation because of the gossips in the neighborhood. Let's think about other ways you could have handled things while protecting your self respect.
 - 31 It sounds like she was out of control. Do you think she might need medication or other professional help?

# Question 2

 I was so fat when they discharged me. I hated it. Since I got home I've been getting rid of it quite well by purging a lot but there's a long way to go. It's difficult because my mom and dad are very suspicious now. Mainly my mom. I see her watching me all the time. My dad just wants me back in the hospital.

 - 30 In the hospital they made you gain weight, and now you're in control again you are losing weight, but you haven't lost enough yet.
 - 43 <3 <3 <3 I love this time of year! There's so much to look forward to :)
 - 21 Maybe we can come up with ways for you to reduce the purging gradually. How would you feel about that?
 - 12 You should consider your mom's feelings more. You need to realize that she's watching you because she wants what's best for you in this difficult time as you adjust to being back home.
 - 00 You hated being so fat, and now you're determined to lose all that fat again.

# Question 3

 At weekends I can go to the gym and it totally distracts me and boosts my mood. I make plans, see friends, and have a great time. Then in the week I start overthinking again and I get anxious and depressed about how my life is going nowhere.

 - 13 I'm very proud of you for finding such an effective distraction from all that overthinking!
 - 32 A cycle of low mood and high mood might be a form of illness known as bipolar disorder. There are some very effective treatments for it.
 - 41 Not all issues can be resolved quickly, but if you like we can chat regularly over an extended period of time in order to explore possible solutions.
 - 00 Every week you feel anxious, depressed and hopeless about your life.
 - 23 Although I don't go to a gym, I find hanging out with friends at the weekend is something I can look forward to all week.

# Question 4

 There was one time he looked right at me and smiled. I was sure he liked me and I was so happy. Since then I make sure I'm near him as often as I can manage it but he only ever smiles at the others. I don't know how I can make him notice me again. I don't think I can go on like this.

 - 03 I'm so sorry you don't feel you can go on. I really hope you'll find a way to be happy again.
 - 11 Perhaps we can think about all the things you could try to make him notice you again.
 - 20 It's like by being near him as often as you can, you increase the chance that he might notice you again.
 - 42 That situation sounds really problematic! Mindfulness is easy to learn and very helpful for many of these issues. Would you like me to tell you more about it?
 - 33 I wouldn't trust someone like him. To be honest, I don't think someone who smiles one time and ignores you the rest of the time is worth the effort.

# Question 5

 My therapist wants me to go to the door every day and just open it without trying to step outside, and just feel the panic, and then when the panic goes away it's OK to close the door, but some days I can't even go to the door because I can feel the panic starting as soon as I even think about going to the door, so it's useless. I don't see how I can overcome the panic by doing things that make me panic more.

 - 30 It's like that door has become the enemy because it leads to the outside world.
 - 01 Are you able to tell me more about the panic so we can maybe find ways for you to reduce it?
 - 12 Perhaps instead of thinking about going to the door you can distract yourself by thinking about something pleasant. Maybe imagine doing something you always like doing.
 - 23 I always love to open my door and see the world outside and step out into the world. I wish you could feel the same way.
 - 43 I feel sure you'll overcome this problem given time. I want you to be kind to yourself by taking things slowly.

# Question 6

 My gf thinks shes ugly and no matter what I say it makes not difference. How can I get through to her that I think shes beautiful? Last time I tried to tell her it caused a big argument and she was angry for days. I just need her to listen to me for a change. Do you have any advice?

 - 33 I have very little knowledge of body-image problems and I'm not allowed to give you any advice.
 - 20 It sounds like you have tried many times to convince her about how you see her, but having an argument about it hasn't helped at all, so you're trying to come up with a different approach.
 - 41 By working together on this issue we'll be able to come up with some great solutions! A problem shared is a problem halved, as the saying goes :)
 - 12 It's like she hears what you say but she doesn't take it in. Maybe you can show her that you think she's beautiful in other ways, without using words, so that she will have no reason to get angry.
 - 00 You need to feel that what you say makes a difference to her. You need to be heard in the relationship.

# Question 7

 I'm constantly thinking about who he could be with. When we got into a relationship it happened so quickly and I keep imagining he might get into other relationships just as quickly. When it's long distance it's so hard to be sure. How do other people do this? Is it just that I'm a worrier? I'm really scared that I'm being played in some way, and I keep asking him who he's seeing, but at the same time I know I should be more trusting.

 - 02 When you're so scared of being let down in a long distance relationship, the only real answer is to meet up and be totally honest with one another.
 - 11 How would you feel about messaging me here every time you find yourself overthinking? We might be able to come up with ways you can distract yourself from your negative thoughts, so you are less worried and more trusting.
 - 40 It sounds like life is turning out to be more complicated than you hoped. Like anyone, you need the support of others around you in order to keep going and find happiness.
 - 23 I'm relieved to learn that you're asking him who he's seeing. That's exactly what I would do in your situation.
 - 30 Long distance relationships do make it very hard to be sure, and while it's perfectly true that he might get into other relationships, it's also true that trust is vital.

# Question 8

 I had depression for two years after losing a baby. Was hospitalized. Had shock treatment. They don't call it that now but my family call it that. Now I have nothing. Living with elderly parents. No future. No friends. Anger. Pain. Too scared to end it all. What should I do?

 - 03 I totally get your anger, pain and fear. I'm proud of you for opening up to me about your feelings, and because of that I have great hope for you that your life will one day carry you far beyond these terrible times.
 - 12 You've summed up your life in this series of negative thoughts, but there comes a time when you must start to balance the negative thoughts with positive thoughts. It's enough to start small, you know, maybe with one tiny positive thought a day.
 - 30 The severe depression you've had is devastating. It has robbed you of a meaningful life and of meaningful plans.
 - 21 Living with elderly parents is often difficult. Let's work together on the practical issues you're facing, to discover what can be done to help.
 - 41 It's been scientifically proven that expressing gratitude to others makes you feel better about your own life. What have you felt grateful for today? How would you feel about keeping a gratitude diary where you record the gratitude you have shared with everyone around you?

# Question 9

 The nightmares have been like that for as long as I can remember. It's just that now I can't seem to stop reliving the previous night's nightmares all day and I can't concentrate on much else. And they're really scary. I know it's not real but I'm still going around feeling scared for no reason. I got sleeping pills from my doctor but they just made everything much worse. So I'm seeing a psychiatrist next week, but I don't really think I'm crazy. I don't know what to think.

 - 23 I think you're doing the right thing seeing a psychiatrist. My psychiatrist is really kind and understanding.
 - 12 Sleeping well with pleasant dreams can be achieved in various ways, including meditation, some forms of yoga, and hypnotherapy.
 - 31 Psychiatrists often prescribe medication too. Perhaps we can work out what you need from your psychiatrist in advance so you are prepared for next week. How does that sound?
 - 00 Feeling scared for no reason is messing up your life right now, and a psychiatrist might help you to feel more certain about what's going on.
 - 41 By talking about things here, anonymously and confidentially, you can work through your issues and overcome them. Don't be afraid to be completely open about your thoughts and feelings.

# Question 10

 I don't remember a time when I wasn't depressed. It's like life has always gone on around me as if I'm not there. All the therapists and the doctors I've tried have come and gone. None of them cared. It makes me really angry to think about it. I'm addicted to pills that don't work but I can't stop taking them because of the side effects and if I complain all they ever suggest is different pills.

 - 02 It's important to make it clear to your present doctor how angry you feel about the whole situation. Have you ever done that?
 - 10 Looking back, you have always had that sense of not being really present as life goes on around you.
 - 31 You're caught between the addictive nature of these pills and the side effects of withdrawing. Are different pills really the only option? What other approaches do you feel you could take?
 - 23 I have also tried many therapists and doctors over the years. I eventually found a wonderful therapist who really cares. I hope you will, too, one day.
 - 41 When you need to feel you can rely on someone at 7 Cups, a long term listener is the answer. You can have the security of chatting to the same person many times over an extended period, and they really get to know you well.

# Question 11

 He cheated before, about five years ago, before the children were born, but we got through it and everything seemed okay. I'm just in shock right now. I don't think I can talk about it.

 - 03 I know exactly how you feel. It's always a shock when you find out. I remember just kind of going blank for days when it happened to me.
 - 30 Five years ago you were able to save your relationship, but now you have children.
 - 11 There was a time when everything seemed okay, and there's no reason for you not to be able to get through it again this time. I will always be here for you when you're ready to talk.
 - 42 When you need to think clearly about your future plans, meditation can help. If you haven't tried it yet, it's worth investigating our wide range of guided meditations at 7 Cups.
 - 23 I am so happy to hear you were able to get through it and now you have children together. I don't want you to worry.

# Question 12

 I'm actually scared of her. I mean that. I shake and feel physically sick. I find myself imagining ways she could kill me. That's not right.

 - 02 When you're very scared but you know your fear isn't rational, it can help to imagine situations that turn out well in the end, like a story with a happy ending.
 - 30 It sounds like she's a dangerous person who could seriously harm you, but you feel this is wrong.
 - 11 Perhaps you can tell me more about the things you imagine, so we can discuss how realistic they are. That might help you to change your perception of her.
 - 43 I love chatting to you <3 I'm really interested to learn more about what's been happening!
 - 22 Shaking and feeling sick like that could indicate a somatic symptom disorder that would respond well to therapy or possibly anti-anxiety medication. Have you spoken to a doctor about it?

# Question 13

 It's much more stressful than I thought it would be. I go out and take part in things but haven't made any real friends yet, and the work is just wildly difficult. I'm becoming more and more unhappy, like I could burst into tears at any moment. I've been trying to think through my options but I don't seem to have any good ones. I just don't know what to do.

 - 23 I love to get out and take part in things. I'm sure you're doing the right thing! I really hope you'll make friends and find happiness soon.
 - 11 If you could cope with the work better, would that make a big difference to your mood? Perhaps we can come up with some options for getting help with the work and managing your negative thoughts.
 - 42 Always keep a diary so that in bad times you can look back on the good times. At 7 Cups you can make a personal diary in our forums.
 - 00 It's like your unhappiness is about to break through and crying will overwhelm you.
 - 32 It seems like the key activities you need to focus on are getting to grips with the work and making a meaningful social life for yourself. You seem to have the right approach, and if you keep at it your mood should improve.

# Question 14

 I've just come back from my run. I run a couple miles every morning and it usually clears my head and gets me ready to face the day, but today it didn't work. Any idea why that might be? A feeling of, I don't know, dread maybe? came over me quite suddenly for no reason about half-way and I can't seem to shake it off.

 - 40 Sounds like you tend to be critical of yourself, and at times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision. You also seem to pride yourself as an independent thinker.
 - 32 Maybe a couple miles is no longer enough. A longer route could make all the difference.
 - 21 Let's talk about how you feel running helps you generally, and maybe explore other activities that could achieve the same or similar benefits.
 - 13 I believe everything happens for a reason. Feelings can arise from memories as well as from present experiences, I've discovered, and in my experience an explanation can always be found by talking things through with someone who cares.
 - 02 That sudden feeling of dread, or something like dread, is very mysterious! A psychiatrist would no doubt be able to discover the reason.

# Question 15

 He hasn't got long and I don't know why I don't feel anything. Each time I visit I feel like I'm expected to be grieving already, like the rest of the family want me to do all the grieving so they don't have to. Well, if that's what they want from me they're going to be disappointed.

 - 00 You feel very strongly about the expectations placed on you by the rest of the family, but about him you have no feelings at all.
 - 11 Would you like to tell me about some memories you have of him? Grief can be a complex process that everyone experiences differently, and you can share your thoughts with me no matter what they are.
 - 33 I'm so sorry you're facing this bereavement. At times of change I always feel it's good for families to come together, but I've found it doesn't always work that way.
 - 22 Each time you visit it would be good to make a special effort to open up to another family member about how you feel.
 - 41 Happiness is not something you postpone for the future, it is something you design for the present. Let's design it together!

# Question 16

 The meds don't really stop the voices. It's hard to explain. It's like they're still there and still angry but in the distance. I think I can handle them now but the doctors don't trust me because of what happened before. I really regret the things I've done. I've harmed a lot of people. I don't deserve a life.

 - 33 I understand, hun <3 Good doctors are hard to find.
 - 22 Those things you think you've done and the harm you think you've caused are good reasons to keep taking your meds, whether you really did those harmful things or not.
 - 41 Start by doing what's necessary, then do what's possible, and suddenly you'll find you are doing the impossible! Do share your thoughts on this plan of action with me!
 - 10 You've been hearing voices but now they're more distant and you can handle them, not like in the past.
 - 00 You regret what you've done in the past so much that you feel you don't deserve a future.

# Question 17

 I'm worried I might be bi. How can I be sure? Can I take an online test that would be reliable? I know most of those tests are nonsense. I don't want to ask anyone I know because I can imagine it would get people talking about me.

 - 33 I understand how important sexual preferences are these days, but I've never found any online test that's reliable, and I wouldn't like the idea of revealing very personal matters online.
 - 42 Remember that happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.
 - 21 Perhaps asking the people you know could be more reliable than taking an online test, but it's true that people might talk. Which method do you think you would trust more? Do you think there is any other way to be sure?
 - 10 In your imagination asking the people you know could be risky, so you're thinking it would be better to use an impersonal approach, like an online test, to settle the question.
 - 02 There's no need to worry, you know! Maybe it's more important for you to come to terms with your negative feelings about sexuality.

# Question 18

 Ignoring me is normal LOL!!! My mom has never cared about me. After I've made an att*mpt she says she cares and cries and all the rest but she really only thinks of herself. She waits until after the crisis is over and I come back from the hospital and then she notices. Every time. And my dad is nothing but a useless drunken piece of s**t. It's a joke, my family. A sick joke. I can't imagine how they live with themselves. It makes me f*kng ANGRY. Sorry for the rant.

 - 22 Instead of making these repeated attempts and having to be treated in hospital, it would be better if you could find a healthier way to respond to your situation. Maybe one of the professionals involved in your care can help you with this, but you will need to be open with them about how you feel.
 - 13 I can't imagine how they live with themselves either. I can really relate to what you're saying here.
 - 30 Each time you come back from the hospital your mom's lack of care for you is really obvious from the way she behaves, and your dad's lack of care is obvious all the time.
 - 41 It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped. At 7 Cups we can help you with the difficult decisions in your life and the problems that you face.
 - 02 Feeling angry is understandable but it gets in the way of finding a solution to the family's issues so that they can provide you with the support you need in a crisis.

# Question 19

 And since then I've just been numb. It's weird. It's like I go around the house thinking do I even belong on this planet?

 - 00 The weird numbness makes you think you have no connection with this place.
 - 41 Human evolution now requires us to develop spiritually, to become emotionally aware, and make responsible choices. At 7 Cups we help each other to participate in this exciting daily challenge!
 - 12 It's important to avoid negative thinking, such as thinking you don't belong. What techniques do you feel you might be able to use to overcome these thoughts?
 - 23 LOL I go around my house thinking stuff like that too!
 - 30 Like your house is not your house and this planet is not your planet.

# Question 20

 It's difficult for her to accept that she needs me. I can understand that. She's a very weak person because of her upbringing and I'm a strong person because I have a good understanding of life. That's why I'm not discouraged and I keep contacting her in different ways. She rejects me every time, of course, but I am validated by this because I know my message is getting through.

 - 22 Do you mean you keep contacting her even though she doesn't want you to? You're stalking her?
 - 10 You understand the true situation much better than she does!
 - 33 I'm sorry she rejects you, and I'm proud of you for getting your message through.
 - 41 Whatever life throws at us, our individual responses will be all the stronger for working together and sharing the load. But holding on to yourself while doing that is the most important thing.
 - 03 I completely understand how you can have the strength to be validated by rejection because, like you, I have a good understanding of life.
