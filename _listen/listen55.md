As a listener you are entitled to support from 7 Cups administration and from the listener community.

To contact 7 Cups administration about any serious concern, [Submit a request](https://help.7cups.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in the Help Center. Alternatively, send an e-mail from the address you used when you registered as a listener, to: community@7cups.com

For immediate help, even in the middle of a chat, go to the Listener Support Room.

To discuss your feelings following any chat, or for help with your approach to listening, contact a mentor.

For less urgent questions and support, and to contribute ideas, use the listener-only area of the forums.

For technical support, see the [Help Center](https://help.7cups.com/).

To find out what any special 7 Cups terminology means, see the [Glossary](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/glossary).

To chat with any other listener about anything at all related to listening, just go to their profile and send a message, even if they're offline. Listeners constantly support each other!

For emotional support with other areas of your life, use your member account. It's up to you whether you disclose that you're also a listener.

If you are let down or badly treated by another listener, report them through the [Help Center](https://help.7cups.com/) or by e-mail. If you seek help in the Listener Support Room and no one there helps you, report all the listeners who were present in the room.

There are no more quizzes. In the next section we'll summarize your first steps as a listener.
