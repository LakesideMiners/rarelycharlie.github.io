to find out what they mean.

## [How-to guides](/howto)
A collection of how-to guides is being developed, and a few of them are already available.

## Site map
An alphabetical map of the 7 Cups website is being developed, but it is not available yet.

## App map
An alphabetical map of the 7 Cups app is planned. It will be part of the site map, but 
work on it has not started yet.

## Skills training
Training modules to help 7 Cups users learn skills are planned, but work on them have not
started yet.
