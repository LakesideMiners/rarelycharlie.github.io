So...this is a kind of ranty opinion piece that doesn't belong anywhere, about how 7 Cups might have done things, which is completely different from how 7 Cups actually did do things because 7 Cups didn't start from where it is now with the hindsight it now has.

A good principle is that if there's something you can do better than anyone else, do it, and if there's something you can only do worse, don't do itâ€”get out of the way and let whoever is good at it do it.

### What is 7 Cups for?

The active parts of 7 Cups broadly break down into forums, group chats and 1-to-1 chats. But the things people come to 7 Cups for don't break down that way. People come to solve the problems of everyday life (relationships, mostly), to get emotional support (in bereavement, for example), because they have mental illness (depression, for example), and because they are seeking somewhere to belong (a community).

A better way to organize 7 Cups would have been to categorize what's on offer using the reasons people come: Problem solving, Support, Mental illness, Community.

### 7 Cups limitations

In each category there are limits to what the listeners and members at 7 Cups can provide, but when anyone reaches the limit there's a void between 7 Cups and whatever's next.

For example, someone seeking a solution to an everyday problem will get limited help at 7 Cups because we are not experts, but we don't actively send people off to Quora (for example) where they might get answers from experts.

Someone seeking emotional support might need more support than listeners and members can give, but we don't actively send people off to local real-life sources of support.

For someone who has a mental illness we can provide online therapy, but it costs more money than many people can afford (and it's not clear how good it really is). We don't actively send people off to free online therapy services like MoodGym.

For someone seeking community because they are lonely, we actively discourage offsite contact, teaching them that being with other people is risky.

### 7 Cups dangers

Worse than 7 Cups' limitations, there are dangers in 7 Cups' approach if someone gets the wrong kind of help.

For example, if someone expects problem-solving, and what they get is a medical diagnosis as if they have a mental illness, there's a danger it will make it less likely they will solve their problem.

Or, if someone has a mental illness, and what they get is community, there's a danger they will feel they have to accept their illness because being ill is rewarded by the community, and if that happens they are less likely to recover.

### What is listening?

There's deep confusion over what listeners are supposed to be doing.

The initial training hints that it's about active listening, but the initial mock chat hints that it's about amateur diagnosis and treatment. New listeners are often bewildered when people seem to expect advice, because they've been told not to give advice. Some give advice anyway, and some just leave 7 Cups.

A better way to train listeners would be to train them in the four categories separately, so they can give advice to those who need it, give support to those who need support, and so on.

### The technology platform

7 Cups only fully works using the website. The app doesn't do anything useful unless it can connect back to the website behind the scenes. There was never any point in creating the app, except as a marketing gimmick.

Soon after 7 Cups began, something went wrong between the tech side and the community side, causing poor tech support for the community to become embedded as a 7 Cups tradition.

A better way to manage the tech would be to outsource it, or at least to use open source components. Forums and web chat are commonplace and cheap. Some tech support would still be needed, and the people who do that work should be day-to-day users of the systems they are supporting so that they can respond to what's required.
