It can be supportive to a member to disclose your own experience of a similar situation, but only if you are comfortable doing this. It is OK if you choose never to disclose anything about yourself to members.

If you do choose to self-disclose, ensure that it is specifically relevant to the conversation, and be very brief. Never leave self-disclosure dangling at the end of a message. Always return the conversation to the member's situation so that you yourself do not become the subject of the conversation.

Don't use self-disclosure to invalidate or judge what a member tells you. Their experience of life and your experience of life are different, no matter how similar you think they may be.

Member: *“Has that ever happened to you?”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“Yes, when I was about 13 a similar thing happened to me a few times. Fortunately my mother was a nurse and knew what to do. Do you have someone in your life you can rely on to know what to do?”*
{: .conv}

Some members will ask you questions about yourself, and if you self-disclose they will follow up with more questions so that you effectively switch places and they become the listener. To avoid switching places, it is very important to bring the conversation back to the member.

After the quiz, we'll look at some some things that can get in the way of emotional support.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“They don't understand that I need to check. I need to!”*
{: .conv}

*“They always treat me like a child.”*
{: .conv}

*“I get so frightened sometimes if they don't allow me to check, then it's like I can't breathe and I can feel my heart thumping.”*
{: .conv}

*“I don't know how long my heart can take that.”*
{: .conv}
