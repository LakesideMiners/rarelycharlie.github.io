Smart Links is an additional menu for the 7 Cups website. The Smart Links menu continuously learns which 7 Cups webpages you use most often, and provides upiu with 1-click access to them. As your use of the 7 Cups website changes, the Smart Links menu continuously adapts.

Some Smart Links features are experimental, and some might not work. Smart Links is only supported on a best efforts basis without any guarantees. The current version is 0.1.
