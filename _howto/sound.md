*Listener Sound Options* adds options for listeners to customize the sounds that 7 Cups uses as alerts.

You can specify custom sounds, and you can mute alerts for general requests (so you only hear alerts for personal requests).

### Who can use Listener Sound Options?
You can probably use Listener Sound Options if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on a computer.

You might be able to use Listener Sound Options if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on an Android device.

You cannot use Listener Sound Options on an Apple iOS device.

You cannot use Listener Sound Options if you use the 7 Cups App on any kind of device.

### What you need
To use Listener Sound Options, you need to install two things in this order:

1. First install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in your web browser.

   If your web browser is not compatible with Tampermonkey, then you probably cannot proceed with the next step. However, at [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en) you can find some information about alternatives to Tampermonkey.

2. Next, install the [Listener Sound Options](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/406921-7-cups-listener-sound-options) script.

To install each of these in turn, click the relevant link and follow the instructions.

### Settings
To customize sounds, go to your My Settings page (by logging in to 7 Cups, clicking on your own profile image at the top right, and choosing My Settings from the menu).

Listener Sound Options adds a **Listener Sound Options Theme** section to the page:

![Settings](/assets/soundpref.png)

Specify a sound file URL to override a 7 Cups sound with a custom sound.

Check the box "Mute general request alerts" if you only want to hear alerts for personal requests.

### Known issues
 - You cannot specify different custom sounds for general and personal request alerts.

 - In some browsers you cannot use local sound files as alerts. This is a securoty feature.

### Removing Listener Sound Options
If you want to remove Listener Sound Options, you can temporarily disable the script or you can delete it. You can also disable or delete Tampermonkey.
