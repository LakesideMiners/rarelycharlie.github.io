To remember a listener so you can chat again in future, you do not usually have to do 
anything special. The system keeps a list of your chats. You can simply return to an 
old chat and send another message.

Another way is to go to the listener's profile and press the Follow button. To find the
listener again in future, go to your own profile and click on the number just above the 
word Following (in pale gray near the top).

A third way is to go to the listener's profile and bookmark it in your web browser.

To find the profile of a listener, member or therapist you can click on their profile 
image anywhere you see it in 7 Cups. If you only get a pop-up message, click on their 
name in the message.

Alternatively, you can type the name of any listener, member or therapist in the box 
here and press the Go to Profile button:
