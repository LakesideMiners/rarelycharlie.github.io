## The Walrus and the Carpenter *by Lewis Carroll*

<div style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
The sun was shining on the sea,\\
<span/>Shining with all his might:\\
He did his very best to make\\
<span/>The billows smooth and bright â€”\\
And this was odd, because it was\\
<span/>The middle of the night.
</div>
