To leave 7 Cups you do not need to anything special. Simply stop visiting the website or stop using the app. Optionally delete any bookmarks that go to 7 Cups, or delete the app.

If 7 Cups sends you mail, change your [Settings](https://www.7cups.com/member/editAccount.php) to stop any regular mail you receive. Optionally change your mail provider's settings to delete all mail from 7 Cups.

Optionally tell any communities you have been involved with that you are leaving. You could also put a message in your profile, and post to your feed.

### Deactivating your account
To deactivate your account, go to [Self-Care Break](https://www.7cups.com/member/deactivate.php).

Alternatively, go to your Settings page, scroll to the bottom, and click the Self-Care Break link there. Although it's called "self-care break" you can use it to leave permanently.

When your account is deactivated, your profile, feed, chats and profile image are not visible. Your screen name is mostly invisible (except that some people might have tagged you in forums, and the tags will still be visible).

You can return to your deactivated account at any time and reactivate it.

### Permanently deactivating your account
To deactivate your account more permanently, so that you cannot ever reactivate it, first change your e-mail address and password to random strings that you will not be able to remember.

Here are a random e-mail address and password that you can copy and paste:

{% include rand-cred.html %}

After randomizing your e-mail address and password, save the changes. Then deactivate your account as described above.

### Deleting your account
7 Cups' terms of service imply that you can ask for your account to be deleted. It is not clear what this really means. If someone else reused your old screen name, there could be confusion in forums and elsewhere in the community, so it's possible that your screen name can never be deleted from the system.

If you want to ask for your account to be deleted, you can try sending an e-mail request from the e-mail address that you used when you created the account, to: community@7cups.com

Mail sent to this address can take some days to get a response.

If that does not work, send a written and signed request by postal mail to:

7 Cups of Tea\\
1040 Camino Real South\\
Virginia Beach\\
VA 23456\\
USA

Use a delivery service that informs you when your request has been delivered. 

(The terms of service say you can fax the request, but no fax number is available.)
