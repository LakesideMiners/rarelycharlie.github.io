# Introduction

![7 Cups logo](/assets/guide/7 Cups.png){: style="height: 115px; width: 135px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

This is a guide to 7 Cups originally written for therapists, although anyone can read it.

This guide is an overview that covers most parts of 7 Cups, explaining how it works without going into a lot of detail. It is intended to provide 7 Cups therapists with basic information about the rest of 7 Cups.

Therapists who need more information about therapy at 7 Cups can read the separate guide: [Ethics & Online Therapy](https://www.7cups.com/ethics-and-online-therapy/) (but this link only works if you are logged in as a 7 Cups therapist).

### Contents {#toc}

7 Cups develops continuously, leaving parts of this guide out of date until its next revision. Unless otherwise stated, the information in this guide is believed to be correct at the time of the last revision: June 2018

Please provide feedback to the author if you notice anything that needs to be corrected in the next revision.


# What is 7 Cups?

7 Cups is a US business that provides both free and paid Internet services in the areas of mental health and emotional support.

It does this through an Internet platform where people can both receive and give support—primarily support for mental health issues, but also support for other common challenges of life. The platform is available as a website at [7cups.com](https://www.7cups.com/) and as an app on Apple iOS and Google Android. There is no Microsoft app.

[![](https://www.7cups.com/cloudfront/img/appleDownload.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/7CupsOfTea/id921814681) &nbsp; [![](https://www.7cups.com/cloudfront/img/androidDownload.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sevencupsoftea.app)
{: style="text-align: center; transform: scale(.5);"}

The app provides a reduced set of features compared to the website, with the exception of translations. The app's user interface is available in many languages, but the website is only available in English. There is a second website at [lite.7cups.com](https://lite.7cups.com/) that is functionally identical to the app, including its translations.

7 Cups is available worldwide, and communication within 7 Cups can be in any of the world's written languages, regardless of the user interface language. Even so, most communication within 7 Cups is in English.

Here's the breakdown of visitors to the website by country at the time of writing (April 2018):

![Countries](/assets/guide/countries.png){: style="height: 255px; width: 593px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

16,348 unique visitors daily, according to siteprice.org in March 2018
{: style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 80%;"}

The 7 Cups platform provides for four types of support: 
- self help
- 1-to-1 text chats
- chatrooms where many people can chat to each other in real time
- forums for interaction over a longer period of time.

Paid therapy at 7 Cups makes use of the platform's 1-to-1 text chats.

### Platform support

Three models of support are implemented on the platform, although they are not completely separate:

- A self help model, using topic-based guides, suggested activities, and goal tracking.
- A peer support model, in which people who have similar kinds of issues are encouraged to support each other.
- An individual support model, using volunteer listeners and paid therapists.

Couple and family support could technically be possible, but they are not implemented.

The platform also supports personal feeds, which are a little like blogs. They are public and they can be indexed by Internet search engines.

It has a restricted-access wiki for reference information. The wiki can mostly be read, but not edited, by the public. The public part is indexed by Internet search engines. The private part of the wiki can only be accessed by listeners.

Some essential platform support is not available onsite, notably calendars (currently provided by [Tockify](https://tockify.com/)) and forms (currently provided by [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)).

Collaborative projects often use Google services for communication between project members, because the onsite alternatives, a forum or the wiki, would be public.

For scheduling purposes 7 Cups time is defined as US Eastern Time. All users are strongly advised to use US Eastern Time when they refer to a time anywhere on the site, so as to minimize confusion about world time zones. The platform does not provide a converter, but there's an unofficial one here: [7 Cups Date and Time](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/7cupstime)

### History and business model

7 Cups began in around 2013 as a telephone service for people seeking anonymous emotional support. When text chat was added soon afterwards, the text chat proved more popular and it was much cheaper to operate, so the telephone system was dropped.

The company was initially funded by venture capital through the Silicon Valley organization [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com) in their Summer 2013 batch of startups. It is now part of the startup accelerator [GSVlabs](http://gsvlabs.com/). 

The original support model was that certain people, designated as listeners, provided the support. Listeners could be volunteers, or they could be paid by the members they supported. The model has changed considerably since then.

Payments to listeners were dropped, and for a while the service relied on donations. Donations still form part of the income stream and are known as the [Compassion Campaign](https://www.7cups.com/backus/compassionJar.php).

Members and listeners who have paid subscriptions are identified in various places on the platform by this icon:

![Sustainability icon](https://www.7cups.com/cloudfront/img/growthPath/sustainability.png){: style="height: 75px; width: 75px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

Sustainability icon
{: style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 80%;"}

Paid therapy was added to the model in early 2016, and by January 2017 the business had grown to the point where its business model had become self-sustaining.

There has never been any explicit advertising within 7 Cups, except for 7 Cups' own sources of income—donations and paid therapy.

The websites, and probably the app, contain trackers originating from a number of business partners associated with the advertising industry, but details of these arrangements are undisclosed. Some other data from 7 Cups' servers may be shared with other parties for research and development purposes, but details are mostly undisclosed.

### Mission

7 Cups’ original mission is explained by its founder, Glen Moriarty, in a [forum post](https://www.7cups.com/forum/GlensNook_84/OurVisionforaBetterWorld_334/OurMission_18219/1/) from February 2015:

<blockquote style="margin: 0 2em 1em 2em; border-left: 2px solid #7bf; padding-left: 1ex;">
<p>7 Cups of Tea is for anyone who wants to live in a world where the human experience is free from stigma and stereotypes and rich with love and support. A world where all 7 billion of us can grow and feel like we truly belong.</p>
<p>We believe that each one of us is inherently valuable. We do not measure people based on where they are from, what they look like, or what position they hold. We recognize that people make sense in the larger story of their lives. We understand that people are complicated and that life is not simple or easy.</p>
</blockquote>

Another take on the mission is described in this video (under 2 minutes):

# The four types of account

People who use 7 Cups all have accounts, which come in four types: guest, member, listener and therapist.

### Guests

Anyone who visits 7 Cups is immediately allocated a guest account with a randomly chosen screen name. Names at 7 Cups are normally written with an @-sign at the start. For example, @carefulPear7220 is a typical name. The guest screen name is allocated immediately, but it does not become obvious until the guest interacts in some way with other people on the site.

The guest account persists on the device unless the user takes steps to clear it, or the user's anonymous browsing feature clears it automatically. If the same person visits 7 Cups using a different device, or in a different anonymous session, then a different guest account is created.

People using guest accounts have limited access to 7 Cups. In order to benefit more fully from 7 Cups, a member account is needed.

A guest account is shown within 7 Cups as a square icon with sharp corners and a two-letter abbreviation of the name in it. The color of the icon is determined by the first letter of the name. For example, the guest @carefulPear7220 has the icon:

![Guest icon](/assets/guide/guest icon.png){: style="height: 38px; width: 38px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

Guest icon
{: style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 80%;"}

### Members

Any guest can sign up to convert their account to a member account, which has a password and a profile. The password means the account can be used from more than one device.

A member's profile is public. It can be seen by anyone who visits 7cups.com/@*SomeScreenName* and it can turn up in the results of Internet searches.

7 Cups itself does not provide a way to search for members, but it's possible to do that using the custom Google search here: [Search for profiles](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/howto/profile-search)

Members have more access than guests to the support available, although some features are further restricted to members with certain status.

A member account is shown within 7 Cups as a square icon with rounded corners. Members can use a custom name and icon, but some members keep the name and icon they originally had as guests.

![Member icon](/assets/guide/member icon.png){: style="height: 38px; width: 38px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

Member icon
{: style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 80%;"}

Each member's profile contains:
- Information about their activity and reputation on 7 Cups
- Biographical information (if the member chooses to write some)
- A button that a listener can use to start a 1-to-1 chat
- A button that anyone other than a guest can use to follow the member's feed
- The feed itself

The buttons are only visible to people who are permitted to use them. For example, if a teen listener looks at an adult member's profile, there is no Send Message button.

### Listeners

Anyone can sign up to become a listener by completing a short online training module. Listeners generally have the same access to the site as members, with some additional features that are only available for listeners.

Listeners are intended to provide support to members. They also support each other in the work of being a listener. Listeners are encouraged to have a separate member account to use when they need support for their own personal issues. The platform supports easy switching between the two accounts.

Listeners' profiles are also public, and 7 Cups provides a way to search them on the [Browse Listeners](https://www.7cups.com/BrowseListeners.php) page. Listeners' profiles contain similar kinds of information to members' profiles, although the details are different.

A listener account is shown within 7 Cups as a round icon. For example:

![Listener icon](/assets/guide/listener icon.png){: style="height: 38px; width: 38px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

Listener icon
{: style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 80%;"}

### Therapists

Anyone who is permitted to practice psychotherapy or counseling in their own local legal jurisdiction can sign up for a therapist account.

Therapists can pay to be included in a directory in order to provide paid support to members. All therapists have public profiles, even if they are not in the directory. 7 Cups provides a way to search the directory at: [Search Therapists](https://www.7cups.com/therapists/search.php)

Therapists' profiles contain similar kinds of information to members’ and listeners' profiles, although the details are different. There is no button to start a chat, because to chat with a therapist a member must first set up payment. Therapists' feeds are not published in their profiles, but there is a button so that any member or listener can follow a therapist's feed.

Some other information in therapists' profiles is optional, and does not appear in every profile—for example, the therapist's in-office hourly rate and a link to their website.

A therapist account is shown within 7 Cups as a round icon exactly like a listener account.

### Reputation

Members, listeners and therapists at 7 Cups have persistent identities, and the system keeps records of their activity. Some of these records are summarized on each of their profiles, and this data as a whole is known as reputation. Member, listener and therapist reputation are handled in a broadly similar way but with differences in the detail.

A cheer is the basic reputation point awarded for activity. For example, a member who sends a message in a chatroom gets 2 cheers. A member or listener's headline reputation is a whimsical name, like Confident Walk 3, based on the cumulative number of cheers the person has earned.  Thus, the headline reputation is based mainly on the quantity of interactions.

Compassion hearts are also points awarded for activity, like cheers, but for different activities. The compassion hearts system is not as important as the cheers system.

Listeners' and therapists' profiles include star ratings based purely on 1-to-1 chats, and they also include a list of positive reviews following chats. (Negative reviews are not included.)

Members and listeners also earn badges that represent various achievements. There are hundreds of badges. Some of them are awarded automatically by the platform, some are awarded by nomination, and some have to be applied for.

For more information, see:  [Listener Reputation](https://www.7cups.com/about/faqBadgesCheers.php) and [Member Reputation](https://www.7cups.com/about/memberReputation.php)

### Self-care breaks

Although rarely used by listeners and very rarely by therapists, there is a facility for any member, listener or therapist to take a complete break from 7 Cups at any time, suspending their account temporarily. This is often known as a self-care break, although it can be for any reason.

When they do this their profile completely disappears as if they never existed. Their name and icon disappear from almost everywhere in the platform, and their name appears as Unknown in forums. If and when they return from their break, their name and icon reappear everywhere.

Listeners and therapists who have ongoing responsibilities at 7 Cups generally avoid using this facility.

After the quiz, the next section describes how a new user's experience of 7 Cups is structured.

# Onboarding and agreements

Incoming referrals to 7 Cups come from a variety of sources. Members and listeners are encouraged to provide referral links on social media and elsewhere. 

A referral link contains a reference number that secretly credits the owner of the link. All referral links link directly to the front page at 7cups.com so the person who clicks the link cannot tell who, within 7 Cups, owns the link. This helps to keep members' and listeners' onsite and offsite identities separate.

A team of "social soldiers" also publicizes 7 Cups on social media.

### Onboarding

On visiting the main page of the website, or on starting the app, a process of "onboarding" encourages a new user to sign up as a member and to specify the issue they need support with.

![Onboarding](/assets/guide/onboarding.png){: style="height: 160px; width: 275px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

Onboarding front page
{: style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 80%;"}

However, visitors to the site also arrive from Internet searches and various other direct links. These guests can use parts of the site that do not involve interacting with other people, but before interaction with other people they have to either log in or declare their age range and agree to 7 Cups' terms of service and privacy policy.

7 Cups also has associate agreements with various organizations, such as some colleges. Each organization has its own portal webpage that gives its members access to a subset of 7 Cups. For example, an organization can have its own listeners who chat exclusively to its own members.

### Age ranges

Anyone using 7 Cups may be asked to certify their age, that they are not suicidal, homicidal or abusing anyone, and that they agree to 7 Cups' terms of service and privacy policy.

The permitted age ranges are:
- 18 or over
- 13–17 with parental consent

Whether anyone is asked these things depends on how they use the site. Use of the site involving interaction with other people requires answering these questions.

Anyone in the age range 13–17 at 7 Cups is known as a teen, and anyone 18 or over is known as an adult, regardless of their legal status in the real world.

In general, teens and adults cannot communicate at 7 Cups, except in the forums. There are some exceptions. For example, adult listeners can apply for background checks to be carried out, allowing them to communicate with both adults and teens.

There is a category of listeners who are aged 35 or over, but these older listeners are not treated differently in any significant way.
	
### Terms of Service

All users of 7 Cups are required to agree to the [Terms of Service](https://www.7cups.com/Documents/TermsOfService/) before interacting with other users.

### Privacy policy

A [privacy policy](https://www.7cups.com/privacy.php), separate from the terms of service, also covers use of 7 Cups.

7 Cups generally describes the service as "anonymous" but it uses this term in an odd way to mean that you have a name on 7 Cups but it's probably not your real name. Members and listeners may choose to provide their real e-mail address or some other e-mail address when they join.

Guests only have the random name that 7 Cups generated for them. Members and listeners might have random names or other names that they choose, which might be their real life names (though this is rare). Sometimes members and listeners reveal what might be their real first name in their profile. Therapists use their real names.

Guests, members and listeners generally must not provide any information anywhere within 7 Cups that could be used by anyone to contact them offsite (although there are some exceptions).

The platform stores chats for a year.

Members, listeners and therapists can write confidential notes using the [My Notes](https://www.7cups.com/notes.php) feature within the 7 Cups platform. Listeners are not allowed to keep notes anywhere outside the 7 Cups platform, but this rule does not apply to members or therapists.

### Community guidelines

Community guidelines provide everyone who uses 7 Cups with rules for good behavior on the site. Read them here: [Community Guidelines](https://www.7cups.com/about/communityGuidelines.php)

To help manage behavior that violates the guidelines, there is a points system, and within the chatrooms there is another system that tracks warnings given by moderators.

After the quiz, the next section describes 7 Cups' self-help model.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- 7 Cups' Social Soldiers have the task of defending 7 Cups from social media trolls.# They publicize 7 Cups on social media.
- Children under 13 can read anything members post in the forums.#The forums are public, so anyone can read them.
- A child can chat to an adult on 7 Cups.#Only if the child has parental consent and the adult is a listener with a Teen badge.

# Self-help

7 Cups' self-help model provides a collection of tools that support people without requiring any interaction with others.

### Growth paths

Members and listeners are offered sequences of activities known as growth paths. Each activity is rewarded with a point known as a growth point or step. Members' and listeners' paths contain somewhat different activities.

![Growth path](/assets/guide/path.png){: style="height: 200px; width: 216px; display: block; margin: 1em auto 0 auto;"}

The start of a growth path
{: style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; font-size: 80%;"}

A member's growth path is tailored to the issue that they specify on joining. It is also possible for a member to pay for a personalized growth path, but there is little indication that many members do this. The personalized paths are listed here: [Start Feeling Better Today](https://www.7cups.com/backus/upgrade7cups.php)

The general growth paths do not offer any kind of real personal growth. They have no end point or overall goal, and there is no detailed record of achievement. They are rarely discussed in the forums, suggesting that most members and listeners do not take them very seriously.

### Guides

There is a collection of self-help guides that can be used by guests, members, listeners and therapists. They cover some common mental illnesses and other issues that people often need help with.

In general, the guides are cut down versions of other self-help resources available elsewhere. Like growth paths, they are rarely discussed in the forums, suggesting that most members and listeners do not take them very seriously.

### Meditations

There is a large collection of guided meditations, which are audio tracks. All of them can also be found elsewhere. See: [Mindfulness Meditations](https://www.7cups.com/exercises/mindfulness/?showlist=1)

### Questions and answers

A large database of questions and answers allows anyone to look up commonly asked questions on a huge variety of topics, and to read answers that have been contributed by members and listeners. The answers are edited for relevance.

Some of the questions have many answers, and some have none. See: [Questions & Answers](https://www.7cups.com/qa/)

### Goal setting

There is some support for setting personal goals and receiving reminders about them.

### Feeds

Feeds are public blogs where members, listeners and therapists can post any personal material. They can also re-post items from other people's feeds, and award hearts to posts they like in other people's feeds. There is a very limited ability to comment when re-posting.

Anyone with a feed can follow someone else's feed, so that posts from that other feed are automatically displayed.

There is an overall 7 Cups feed that mostly re-posts items from other feeds. [7 Cups Feed](https://www.7cups.com/member/feed.php)

Feed posts can include hashtags, and any hashtag can be followed at 7cups.com/~hashtag (replacing the hash sign with a tilde). For example, to follow #selfcare go to: [7cups.com/~selfcare](https://www.7cups.com/~selfcare)

Some members use a diary thread in a forum to post personal material, instead of using their feed, or in addition. Using a diary thread allows for discussion, and it's perhaps more likely to be read by others in a subcommunity.

After the quiz, the next section describes 7 Cups' peer support model.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- A growth path is a series of recommended activities.#It's an endless series of activities.
- There are self-help guides for common mental illnesses.#The guides cover all the most common mental illnesses.
- 7 Cups provides support for people who want to meditate.#There are many audio meditations.
- At 7 Cups members can find answers to frequently asked questions about life's challenges.#There is an extensive question and answer database.
- At 7 Cups members can write public diaries.#Members can use their feed or the forums for diary entries.
- At 7 Cups members' feeds are confidential.# Feeds are public.
- 7 Cups keeps a record of the number of steps each member has completed on their growth path.#Members' and listeners' profiles show the number of steps completed.
- Violations of community guidelines are tracked using a points system.#The system records points for each violation.
- At 7 Cups the age limit for adult listeners is 35 because all listeners must be in tune with young people.# There is no upper age limit.
- Self help at 7 Cups is always guided by trained listeners.# Self help does not require any interaction with others.
{:.quiz}

# Peer support

A peer support model is implemented in forums and chatrooms.

### Forums

A collection of forums provides for detailed questions and sometimes extended discussions.

Most of the forums are public and can be read by anyone, including guests. Only members, listeners and therapists can contribute to the forums. A few forums are restricted. Some are restricted to listeners, some to therapists, and some to other groups.

In a forum, discussion about a specific topic is known as a thread, and the individual contributions to the thread are known as posts. Members, listeners and therapists can subscribe to threads so as to be notified of new posts. The page [My Forum Threads](https://www.7cups.com/forum/search.php?searchForum=&userSubscribed=on) lists your subscribed threads, or threads you started. (The link can also be found by clicking your own profile image at the top right of most pages.)

Threads in the forums are used for a variety of purposes in addition to discussion. Some contain announcements or reference information. Some are intended for people to check in (and over time these can become very long). In some places in the forums, there are daily or weekly check-in threads to encourage members to stay in touch.

Posts in the forums can be upvoted (but not downvoted). Doing this causes the poster to be notified of the upvote. Inappropriate posts can be flagged for a moderator's attention.

Mentioning someone's name in the forums (with the @-sign at the start of the name) causes them to be notified automatically. This is known as tagging. (The forums do not support hashtags.) Some forum posts tag people secretly by including their names in white on the white background.

The entire collection of forums can be seen at [Forum Home](https://www.7cups.com/forum/) where there are tabs labeled:

- Popular (threads with the latest posts)
- New (the most recently created threads)
- Top (threads with the most upvotes)
- Needs Reply (threads that have no reply)

However, the Popular and Top threads are old check-in type threads that have accumulated huge numbers of responses. There has historically been a problem with forum spam, and it is unresolved at the time of writing.

### Chatrooms

A collection of chatrooms provides for group interaction, but not all the chatrooms are open at all times and the list of chatrooms changes from time to time. Some chatrooms only open occasionally. See: [Chatrooms](https://www.7cups.com/connect/groupChatrooms.php?selectage=adult)

Chatrooms are sometimes like drop-in centers, but sometimes they run structured discussions at times that are announced in advance. There is a schedule where forthcoming discussions are announced: [Community Calendar](https://www.7cups.com/home/communityCalendar.php)

Many chatrooms are associated with subcommunities.

The conversations that take place in chatrooms are sometimes leaderless, and sometimes formally led. Sometimes they are about serious subjects, and sometimes they are social events or games.

Formally led sessions in a chatroom are known as discussions or support sessions.

### Subcommunities

Many of the forums have subcommunities based around them. A subcommunity has a group of forums, possibly some chatrooms, some subscribers, some dedicated members and listeners who organize the subcommunity, and often one or more therapists.

Anyone except guests can join as many subcommunities as they wish. It is also possible to use all the forums without joining any subcommunities.

The subcommunities implement 7 Cups' peer support model. Members can support other members in the forums and chatrooms, and each subcommunity brings together members who feel they face similar issues.

There are a few members who are very active, and very skilled, in providing support to other members, without ever becoming listeners.

### Community

There is a widespread feeling amongst those members and listeners who frequently use the chatrooms and forums that 7 Cups as a whole is an online community.

However, there are guests, members, listeners and therapists who rarely, if ever, use the chatrooms and forums, and whose interactions at 7 Cups are mostly between individuals. For these users the sense of community at 7 Cups is possibly weak. Another way to think of it is that the community is effectively the people who participate in 7 Cups' peer support model.

In order to manage the community side of 7 Cups, the chatrooms and forums, there is a complicated and ever-changing hierarchy of roles. Role titles generally indicate a position in the hierarchy: admin, community manager, ambassador, mentor leader, mentor, moderator, and supporter.

A mentor who is a teen is known as a teen star (because adult listeners who are authorized to chat to teens were originally known as teen mentors, which could have been confusing—they are now known as adult teen listeners).

To progress to higher and higher roles in the hierarchy, members and listeners specialize in some particular area of 7 Cups, such as chatrooms. The collection of roles within a specialist area is known as a track.

The people currently in these various roles are listed at [Our Team](https://www.7cups.com/about/ourteam.php).

A variety of collaborative projects are ongoing in the community at any time. They mostly involve listeners, but sometimes they can also involve members. For example, the development of the [wiki](https://www.7cups.com/wiki/) as an information repository involves members and listeners (and possibly some therapists, too).

After the quiz, the next section describes individual support at 7 Cups.

- A member can provide support to other members.#This is the peer support model.
- A listener can have a separate member account for times when they need support.#A separate member account is strongly encouraged.
- Popular posts in the forums receive upvotes.#There is an upvote button for this.
- Unpopular posts in the forums receive downvotes.# Downvotes are not possible at 7 Cups.
- Members must not name other members in the forums.# Mentioning someone’s name in the forums causes them to be notified.
- Some forums are not public.#For example, some forums are for listeners only, or for therapists only.
- Chatrooms are only used for formal discussions.# Chatrooms are also used for chatting!

# Individual support

1-to-1 chats provide guests and members with individual support from paid therapists, volunteer listeners, and a bot called Noni.

### Initiating chats

1-to-1 chats with a listener can be initiated when a guest or member simply requests a chat. The request enters a single worldwide request queue. Any listener who is free can accept any request in the queue. These requests to chat are known as general requests.

The queue shows the topic of the chat, if the guest or member has indicated any topic, and it shows the language of the chat if it is not English. The great majority of chats are in English.

A guest or member can also browse or search the database of listeners. Listeners who are free to chat are shown in the database with a Chat Now button that initiates a 1-to-1 chat if the listener agrees to it. These requests to chat are known as personal requests.

Listeners who are not free to chat are shown with a Leave Message button, which can be used to arrange a chat later.

Listeners have three status options that they set manually: online, busy and offline. Online means free to accept personal requests. Busy means logged in but not free to accept personal requests. Offline means the same as busy, or it can mean really offline (logged out). Listeners who are busy or offline can still take chats.

A few listeners use booking systems to arrange chats. 7 Cups does not provide any booking system—they are on other websites like [you can book me](https://youcanbook.me/).

Listeners who have a certain level of experience can initiate 1-to-1 chats with members. For example, if a member posts in a forum or participates in a chatroom, a listener can follow up by initiating a 1-to-1 chat. Members can choose not to allow these listener-initiated chats, but few members use this option.

Some listeners indicate in their profiles that they don't take 1-to-1 chats at all at the present time.

Listeners can formally take a break from 7 Cups whenever they like, but when they do this their profile disappears from view and no one can tell what happened to them. As a result, many listeners who take a break do it in a less formal way with an explanatory message in their profile.

### Ending chats

Listeners who find themselves in difficulty in a chat can go to the Listener Support Room in real time and either get help or transfer the chat to another listener. There is no formal or platform-supported transfer process, but transfers do not seem to be a problem.

Listeners who feel a chat violates the 7 Cups member agreement can block or ban the guest or member. The chat ends immediately, and the guest or member cannot restart it. However, some guests and members have been known to return with a new account following a ban.

### Long term support

Listeners are encouraged to maintain contact with members and guests they have chatted to. There is an optional structured program of long term support. The platform itself does not provide any special facilities for longer-term supportive relationships.

Some listeners specialize in long term support and refer to the members they are supporting as "my members". Similarly, some members refer to the listeners who support them as "my listeners".

### Bots

7 Cups has two bots, which are automated systems that mimic human listeners to a limited extent.

Noni is a bot that greets guests and members when they have requested a listener and are waiting in the general request queue. Noni also chats to members and listeners at any time they wish.

![Noni](https://www.7cups.com/cloudfront/img/noniCup.jpg){: style="height: 125px; width: 125px; display: block; margin: 0 auto 1em auto; border-radius: 62.5px;"}

In the general request queue, Noni has a script that obtains some information about the guest's or member's reason for coming to 7 Cups. When chatting in other circumstances, Noni has a large repertoire of canned responses that are triggered by whatever the member or listener says.

Sophia is a bot that greets members who choose to sign up for paid therapy. Sophia follows an inflexible script to obtain the necessary information from the member.

### Referrals

Listeners are somewhat encouraged to suggest paid therapy when they are chatting to someone who, they feel, needs more help than a listener can provide.

Listeners are also somewhat encouraged to suggest specialist helplines and other support services to guests and members with particular needs, even though this is difficult to do in a global context.

When a guest or member is suicidal, homicidal, abusing someone, or in need of emergency services, listeners are required to refer the guest or member to an appropriate external resource and to end the chat. Precise criteria and details of how to make these referrals are not entirely clear, and are often the subject of discussion in the listener-only forums.

### Therapy

Members who sign up for paid therapy first chat to the bot, Sophia, and after providing some information they are either paired with a therapist for a three day free trial, or they can choose a therapist for themselves with no free trial. After that, one change of therapist is allowed.

After the free trial, if there was one, 7 Cups charges the member's card a fixed amount monthly, regardless of the therapist's in-office rate. The member can message their therapist as often as they like. For members who pay the full rate, the therapist will reply at least once a day, Monday to Friday, excluding holidays. For the reduced rate it's at least once a week.

After the quiz, the next section describes how listeners are trained and supported.

# Listener training and support
Listeners are briefly trained in active listening, and they can go on to complete some further training in listening. However, most of the training modules available to listeners are the self-help guides available to everyone.

The forums also contain many posts by listeners offering advice and information to other listeners, almost all of it in the listener-only forums (which therapists cannot see). In future some of this information is likely to be put in the wiki.

Listeners can obtain support from other listeners in a special chatroom, the Listener Support Room. Listeners who commit to supporting other listeners are known as peer supporters and mentors.

### Listener experience

The headline level that a listener has, perhaps something like  Apprentice 7, indicates the number of cheers they have earned, and this in turn mainly indicates the number of messages they have sent (although messages are not the only way to earn cheers). So the listener levels mostly indicate quantity or length of time spent chatting, and not necessarily quality.

The Verified Listener badge is a key indicator of listener quality. Listeners who have this badge get a big purple check mark at the top of their profile. However, the badge has to be applied for and only a minority of eligible listeners choose to become verified.

Some other badges are also good indicators of listener quality. For example, the Jester of Smiles badge is awarded automatically by the platform for good reviews by at least 10 members. Because it doesn't have to be applied for, many listeners have it.

### Listening styles

The initial listener training generally promotes a broadly person-centered style of active listening. Problem solving and other forms of counseling are somewhat discouraged.

However, the other training modules available to listeners are mostly conventional self-help. So it's possible some listeners may feel that because they are "trained" by reading these guides they can try to solve members' problems.

Among listeners who are active in the community there is widespread agreement that listeners should not give advice, but that making suggestions about how members can solve their problems is helpful.

Many listeners choose not to chat about certain subjects, and if those subjects come up in a chat they will hand the chat over to another listener. Some listeners will only agree to chat about subjects they feel they have expertise in, and they announce this in their profiles.

### Listener ratings

At some point during a 1-to-1 chat, or when the chats ends naturally, the guest or member is given an opportunity to rate the listener for helpfulness, empathy, professionalism and responsiveness, and to make a comment. Comments are reviewed, and the good ones are published on the listener's profile. Listeners cannot usually tell who has rated or reviewed them.

The numbers of ratings and reviews are not very informative, because some listeners ask for them and some don't. And the numbers of stars are not very informative either, because some listeners are careful who they chat to and some aren't.

When a chat reaches 30 messages, the listener is awarded a step on their growth path and the guest or member is counted among the "people helped" in the listener's profile.

### Interns

There is an internship program that allows listeners to work towards structured targets over a fixed period. It is mainly intended for sudents, but anyone can take part. For more information, see: [7 Cups Internship Program](https://www.7cups.com/about/internships.php)

There is also a less formal program of certification for listeners, but it is not much used.
