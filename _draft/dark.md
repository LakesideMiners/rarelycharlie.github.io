*Dark* is a customizable theme modifer for 7 Cups that provides an inverted (white on black), high contrast or low contrast theme.

At the present time, Dark is still being developed. It's possible that future versions might work better.

### Who can use Dark
You can probably use Dark if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on a computer.

You might be able to use Dark if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on an Android device.

You cannot use Dark on an Apple iOS device.

You cannot use Dark if you use the 7 Cups App on any kind of device.

### What you need
To use Dark, you need to install two things in this order:

1. First install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in your web browser.

   If your web browser is not compatible with Tampermonkey, then you probably cannot proceed with the next step. However, at [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en) you can find some information about alternatives to Tampermonkey.

2. Next, install the [Dark](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/370980-7-cups-dark-theme) script.

To install each of these in turn, click the relevant link and follow the instructions.

### Turning the theme on and off
To turn the theme on and off, use the button at the top left of the screen (beside the teacup logo):

![Button](/assets/dark/button.png){:style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.75);"}

The theme remembers the setting when you reload the page or go to another page.

### Settings
To customize the theme, go to your My Settings page (by logging in to 7 Cups, clicking on your own profile image at the top right, and choosing My Settings from the menu).

Dark adds a **Dark Theme** section to the page.

When you change the settings, they are applied after a short delay. The theme remembers your settings and you do not have to save your profile (unless you have changed something else there).

Use the Dark theme checkbox to choose a dark (white on black) theme.

Use the Brightness slider to adjust the brightness, if necessary. Its normal position is in the middle (0%).

Use the Contrast slider to adjust the contrast, if necessary. Its normal position is near the right-hand end (100%), but not quite at the end.

The default when you install Dark is: dark theme, brightness -20%, contrast 50%.

The 7 Cups default (without Dark) is: normal theme, brightness 0 (in the middle), contrast 100%

For a high contrast normal theme, try: normal theme, brightness -10%, contrast 120%

For a high contrast dark theme, try: dark theme, brightness 15%, contrast 120%

It is easy to choose settings that make the page unreadable. If you can't even see the sliders, use the button at the top left to remove the custom theme temporarily.

### Known issues
The colors of some elements in the page do not change. This problem mostly affects images.

Dark takes a relatively long time to work every time you load a page. This means that on every page you see normal colors for a moment before Dark kicks in.

### Removing Dark
If you want to remove Dark, you can temporarily disable the script or you can delete it. You can also disable or delete Tampermonkey.
