The emotional support that 7 Cups is designed to provide happens when a member experiences all three components of active listening in the chat—when you, the listener, demonstrate that you are listening, you are present, and you are being supportive.

Several things frequently knock listeners off track, and you should watch out for them in every chat you take.

One of these is self-centered thinking. When a member tells you something and your thoughts turn to how you would feel if that happened to you, then you have really left the chat and gone off into a self-centered daydream.

The chat is not intended to be about your feelings. The chat is about the member's feelings. Guard against talking about your own feelings when you are the listener.

Another is sympathetic thinking. When a member tells you something and you try to imagine what it must be like for them, then again you have left the reality of the chat and you are now in a world of imagination.

Being able to imagine what things must be like for other people makes you a good, kind, sympathetic person. But emotional support is not about imagination. It's about listening, being present and being supportive to the reality of what the member tells you. Guard against making imaginative assumptions.

A third one is problem-solving, especially if a member chats to you about a subject you have some knowledge of. It's hard to set your knowledge aside and see things the way the member sees them.

And a fourth is playing at being a professional, saying the things you think a counselor might say, instead of reflecting what the member tells you.

That's the end of this chapter. After the quiz, Chapter IV looks at some advanced skills you'll need to have.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="True,False"}

*“Food was never a problem until around two years ago. Then she started to become withdrawn at meal times and she lost her appetite, and we noticed she was losing weight.”*
{: .conv}

*“So we took her to a doctor and got blood tests, and he said there was nothing wrong and it's just being a teenager.”*
{: .conv}

*“But she's so thin now, and she seems so angry with me all the time.”*
{: .conv}

*“I really, when think of how she is now and how she used to be I just want to cry.”*
{: .conv}
