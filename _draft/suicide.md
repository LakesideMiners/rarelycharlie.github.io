# Part I
{:.part}

General information for all listeners.

This guide is an unofficial training guide for listeners about chats involving non-emergency suicidal thoughts. It is not a self-help guide for members. If you are not a listener you can still read this guide, but becoming a listener first is recommended as a starting point.

The guide is in many short sections. Most sections have a quiz at the end. You must correctly complete the quiz before you can move to the next section. There is no limit to the number of times you can retry each quiz.

To navigate back to a section you have completed, use the little square links along the top of each page.

Several of the sections in this guide are shared with the guide to chats about [Harm](./harm), because the subjects of the two guides are closely related.

**Trigger warning:** Part I is intended for all listeners and it has no detailed descriptions of suicide. Part II contains more detailed examples and information that some listeners might find upsetting or triggering. It is OK to stop reading at the end of Part I.

# What this guide is for

![decoration](\assets\guide\decoe6g.png){:.decor}

This guide provides information and guidance for those listeners who are willing to chat with with members who talk about their thoughts of suicide, when there is no emergency.

Thoughts of suicide may include thoughts about the past and the present, and risk of suicide in the future. It includes thoughts about the suicide of members themselves and of others.

The goals of this guide are to help ensure that, in this context:
- Listeners understand the purpose and limitations of 7 Cups.
- Listeners understand how to care for themselves.
- Listeners do not mistakenly increase the risk of suicide.
- Listeners have an understanding of the reasons some members may talk about suicide.
- Listeners can continue to apply the principles of active listening effectively when members talk about suicide.

There are links to further information and to public resources that you can share with members.

Everywhere this guide uses the word "members", the information also applies to guests.

The next section is a reminder about the purpose of 7 Cups.

# The purpose of 7 Cups

7 Cups exists because there is an unmet need in the world for emotional support:

> **Our Goal:** We are living in a world with an immense love deficit, which means that none of us is receiving the love we need to reach our true potential, to truly thrive. Our goal is to build a support system, a web, that can hold every member of our world.  We believe that we can fill that love-gap for every person in the world, either because they are an active member of our community or because they are touched personally by someone who has been empowered by 7 Cups of Tea.
	
from [Our Mission](https://www.7cups.com/forum/GlensNook_84/OurVisionforaBetterWorld_334/OurMission_18219/1/)
{:.right}

7 Cups has values that describe how we relate to people. They have since been simplified, but our original values included:

> We do not judge or look down on people. We recognize that people make sense in the larger context or story of their lives. Sometimes it can seem like people are making choices that do not make sense, but this is likely because we do not have all of the details. We understand that people are complicated and that life is not simple or easy.

{:.right}

### Limitations

However, 7 Cups imposes general limitations on the emotional support its listeners provide. If a member clearly says they are actively harming themselves or someone else, then it is generally felt at 7 Cups that you cannot continue the chat.

![decoration](\assets\guide\decom6g.png){:.decol style="margin-bottom: 2em;"}

It is important to be aware that the word "actively" means "taking action". A thought or fantasy is not an action. Planning to take action is not the same as taking action.

For example, someone might have thoughts about making carrot soup. They might clearly imagine the recipe or know exactly where to find it. But these things are not the same as buying the carrots, peeling them and chopping them. There's an essential difference between thoughts and actions.

### Distinguishing thoughts from actions

Some people find the distinction between thoughts and actions obvious, and some people find it difficult. There's a recognized cognitive impairment called thought-action fusion that makes it difficult for people to distinguish between thoughts and actions easily. 

If you suffer from thought-action fusion even slightly you might have to think more carefully than most people when trying to decide whether something is a thought or an action. There's more about thought-action fusion in a later section.

### Outside help

Listeners can sometimes provide members with factual information about sources of help outside 7 Cups, but there are reasons to be careful about doing this. For example, providing information can undermine the real purpose of 7 Cups. There will be more about this, too, later in the guide.

Also later in the guide, there are some reminders about exactly how listeners at 7 Cups go about providing emotional support.

After the quiz, the next section is a reminder about caring for yourself.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Everyone's emotional needs should be met by professionals.# Listeners use active listening to help meet members' emotional needs.
- 7 Cups imposes limitations on the support that listeners can provide.#7 Cups does not allow listeners to support anyone who is actively causing harm.
- Listeners must understand that some people just make no sense.# At 7 Cups we believe everyone makes sense in the context of their lives.
- Listeners must be prepared to do anything for members.# Listeners must care for themselves and set personal boundaries.
- Some people tend to confuse thoughts with actions.#This is known as thought-action fusion, and it is a common thinking problem.
- 7 Cups' goal is to build a support system for everyone.#Our mission is exactly this.

# Self care

7 Cups very strongly encourages you to care for yourself as a priority at all times.

### Boundaries

You should think about your personal boundaries, and make decisions in advance about the kinds of chats you are personally willing to take.

![decoration](\assets\guide\decoe4g.png){:.decor}

You have to make these decisions in advance, as far as possible, because a chat that starts out being about one subject can very quickly change to some other subject. You will need to be able to take action to protect yourself immediately there's a change of subject that goes beyond your personal boundaries.

If you haven't already done so, take a few minutes right now to list the topics of conversation that lie outside your personal boundaries. You could write the list in your [Notes](https://www.7cups.com/notes.php). (The link provided here works for any listener, provided you are logged in to 7 Cups.) Check your list from time to time to remind yourself of it, and also to keep it updated.

It's also OK to be willing to chat about any topic without restriction. In this case you don't need any list. But you should still make the decision not to have any list thoughtfully and in advance.

### When your boundaries are crossed

When a chat goes beyond your personal boundaries, consider handing it over to another listener who has different boundaries. You need the member's consent and also the other listener's consent for this.

1. Tell the member that you are unable to chat about this subject.
2. Tell the member that another listener might be available.
3. If the member agrees, go to the Listener Support Room (the question mark button <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1.2em; height: 1.2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #555; border-radius: .6em; color: #555; font-weight: bold;">?</span> at the top right of the chat).
4. In five words or less, tell the room why you need to hand over the chat. Do not share more details of the chat.
5. When you have identified another listener, provide the member with a link to the other listener's profile. In a chat this looks like `7cups.com/@NameOfListener`
6. Tell the member to press the Leave Message or Chat Now button in the listener's profile.
7. End the chat.
8. Do not discuss the member with the other listener at any time.

If the member does not agree at step 3, tell the member that you have to end the chat, and end the chat.

![decoration](\assets\guide\decom2g.png){:.decol}

If you cannot find any other listener at step 5, ask the member to message a suitable listener from the Browse Listeners page. Provide the link: `7cups.com/BrowseListeners` Explain that the page has a More Filters button at the top, which is useful for finding appropriate listeners.

There is normally no need to block the member. They might want to chat with you about some other topic in the future.

At any stage in all this, allow the member to continue the chat and avoid the problematic subject if that's what they prefer. Some members value the relationship they have established with you more than the precise subject of the conversation.

### After a difficult chat

After a chat that oversteps your personal boundaries, consider chatting to a peer supporter or a mentor about your own feelings. This is particularly important if your feelings persist or if you find yourself thinking about the chat long afterwards.

If a chat affects you emotionally, and this in turn affects your real-life relationships or your ability to live your life normally, do not hesitate to switch to your member account and chat with an experienced listener about what happened and how it affected you.

![decoration](\assets\guide\decoe5g.png){:.decor}

If you have a therapist or someone else in the real world you rely on for emotional support, be open with them about the effect volunteering as a listener at 7 Cups has on you, but do not share any details of any chat.

After the quiz, the next section is a reminder about active listening.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Every listener at 7 Cups must be willing to chat about every possible subject.# Listeners can choose not to chat about subjects they find upsetting or triggering.
- You can use your notes to keep a record of your personal boundaries within 7 Cups.#You can use your notes for any records you want to keep.
- A listener can decide not to have any restrictions on what they are willing to chat about.#Listeners can chat about any subject except active harm being done in the present.
- You can discuss members' problems with other listeners.# Listeners must not share the details of any chat. 
- Caring for members must be your priority. Caring for yourself comes second.# Listeners' priority must be to care for themselves.
- A listener who needs to hand a chat over to another listener should try to get the member's consent first.#The member might prefer to continue with the original listener, if that is possible.

# Brief active listening refresher

This guide assumes you are still familiar with the initial listener training. Here's a selection of exact quotes as reminders:

- "Keep in mind that active listening is not counseling or advice giving."
- "You shouldnâ€™t try to solve their problems."
- "Repeat back to the person the facts that they have just shared."
- "Donâ€™t add questions, commentary, or suggestions."
- "Repeat back expressed emotions."
- "Avoid making assumptions."
- "It is important to not break confidentiality."
- "Donâ€™t hesitate to refer the person if they have needs that extend beyond listening."
- "The primary reason we allow anonymity is because it allows people to seek help without fear of being judged."
- "Being triggered is a normal part of life."
- "Report inappropriate behavior."

If any of these seem unfamiliar, take a few minutes right now to review the [Active Listening](https://www.7cups.com/listener/training/) guide before returning to this guide.

### Emotional support

![decoration](\assets\guide\decoe0g.png){:.decor}

The way listeners at 7 Cups provide emotional support is through active listening, allowing people to feel heard. Emotional support has a particular focus on feelings. The goal is to allow people to express their feelings and to know that their feelings have been heard.

Realistically, life is not simple or easy. People have both positive and negative emotions in response to the events of their lives. Listeners should allow both the positive emotions and the negative emotions to be heard equally.

In response to situations involving thoughts of suicide, people naturally have negative emotions. Listeners at 7 Cups allow people's negative emotions to be heard.

Do not try to suppress members' negative emotions or supply positive emotions. If you do that, you might neutralize a member's natural negative emotions in response to thoughts of suicide, allowing the thoughts to continue.

For example, if a member tells you they are worried about attempting suicide, repeat back the worry they have expressed, just like the listener training says. Do not neutralize the worry or change the subject to something positiveâ€”doing that risks associating the idea of attempting suicide with something positive.

After the quiz, the next section looks at thoughts, actions, and the difference between them.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- When a member says something that expresses emotion, the best thing to do is to say it back to them without suggesting how they can deal with it.#Reflecting emotions accurately is at the heart of active listening.
- 7 Cups encourages positive emotions and discourages negative emotions.# Listeners should not make judgments about what is positive and what is negative.
- Listeners should not try to solve members' problems for them.#Listeners provide emotional support. They do not solve problems.
- Active listening is the best way to provide members with good advice.# Active listening provides emotional support, not advice.
- Listeners must allow members to express their feelings.#Active listening is a way for members to know that their feelings are being heard and understood.
- Listeners must remember to ask members appropriate questions, make wise comments, and suggest effective solutions.# Listeners should not add questions, comments or suggestions when they reflect what members tell them.

# Thoughts and actions

Thought-action fusion (TAF) is a cognitive impairment (a thinking problem) that affects many people in the population, both members and listeners. It causes thoughts to be confused with reality to some degree or other.

![decoration](\assets\guide\decom7g.png){:.decol}

For example, someone affected by TAF might believe thinking about a car crash before driving to work makes it more likely they will crash the car. Or they might believe mentioning the word cancer could make someone they care about more likely to develop cancer.

Mostly, TAF is mild. When TAF causes significant distress it can easily be treated by a mental health professional.

### Members

When members are affected by TAF, it can make them genuinely believe they are at risk of suicide, when the reality is they only have thoughts about imaginary suicide.

When a member describes significant distress because of TAF, a listener cannot give advice or suggest how to solve the problem, but a listener can state a simple fact, like:

|Member:|I can't sleep at night and I can't concentrate during the day because...
|Listener:|That's the kind of thing a professional can help with.
{:.chat}

### Listeners

![decoration](\assets\guide\decoe4g.png){:.decor}

When listeners are affected by TAF, it can make them genuinely believe that a member who wants to talk about thoughts of suicide is attempting suicide, or is at risk of attempting suicide.

In more severe cases, a member doesn't mention suicide at all but the listener imagines suicide. Then the listener's TAF makes the imaginary suicide attempt seem real. This could make the listener say inappropriate things to the member.

For example:

|Member:|Since we broke up I've been feeling sad. When I was younger I would have harmed myself at times like this.
{:.chat}

(The listener imagines the member feeling so sad that she attempts suicide. TAF makes the listener think the member is really about to attempt suicide.)

|Listener:|*You should see a counselor and call a suicide helpline.*{:.warn}
{:.chat}

Do not give members advice in this way, especially when it is based on your own imagination. Instead, repeat back the member's feelings accurately:

|Listener:|*The breakup has caused you sadness, but it's not like when you were younger.*{:.ok}
{:.chat}

If you are aware that you experience TAF to some extent, take particular care to distinguish carefully between your own thoughts and reality that can be verified.

After the quiz, the next section looks at some unintended consequences that can occur when members have memory impairments.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Thought-action fusion is a rare form of mental illness that makes thoughts seem like actions.# Thought-action fusion is not a mental illness, and it is common.
- Talking about flooding tends to make flooding more likely.# Talking about any fear does not make the feared thing more likely to happen.
- When a member describes a problem, the listener should try to imagine the worst that could happen, so they can warn the member about it.# Listeners should not allow their imaginations to interfere with chats.
- Members are sometimes distressed because they fear they might cause harm.#Fear of causing harm is one of the things that can distress people.
- Sadness almost always leads to attempted suicide.# Sadness is an emotion, and no emotion in itself can lead to attempted suicide.
- Prolonged loneliness almost always leads to attempted suicide.# No circumstances in life, not even prolonged loneliness, can in itself lead to attempted suicide.
- The more a member thinks about suicide, the more likely they are to attempt suicide.# Thoughts about suicide do not necessarily lead any to attempt suicide.
