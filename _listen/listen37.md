Being supportive to members means seeing things from their point of view, even if it is not your point of view. You must ensure that the member feels heard and understood, but you must not judge by approving, disapproving or making any other kind of comment.

Being supportive is easy when a member tells you about a situation you know nothing about. It is hard when a member tells you about a situation that seems familiar to you, because you might find yourself strongly tempted to invalidate the member's feelings, give advice or suggest solutions.

Member: *“I was diagnosed with complex PTSD and for the first time I understood what was wrong with me. It explained so much that I had always struggled to make sense of.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“It was a relief to have an explanation after all this time.”*
{: .conv}

As a listener you must reflect the member's feelings about what happened, even if you personally don't believe that a diagnosis of complex PTSD explains anything at all.

There are some useful techniques additional to help you to be supportive:
{: .showul}

- Reflecting the big picture
- Focus on emotional detail
- Self-disclosure

After the quiz, we'll look at each of these in turn.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="True,False"}

*“My mother never trusted me while I was growing up. I would dread having to go home from school because I never knew what she was going to accuse me of.”*
{: .conv}

*“And then whenever other people were around she would be all over me with hugs in a totally false way which I hated even more.”*
{: .conv}
