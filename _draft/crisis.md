If you are in an emergency or a crisis, 7 Cups is not the right place to get support. We cannot deal with emergencies. We cannot provide crisis counselling.

### Emergency

An emergency is when you have already suffered serious harm, or you are certainly about to suffer serious harm. Call your local emergency services immediately. Do not waste time chatting on 7 Cups.

|In the US, call:|9-1-1|
|In India, call: |112  |

In any other country, if you do not know the number and you are using a smartphone try the international emergency number, 112. If you are using any other type of phone, ask someone what the local emergency number is. 

### Crisis

A crisis is when you are at immediate risk of serious harmâ€”for example, if you are taking action to end your own life. Contact a local crisis service immediately. Do not waste time chatting on 7 Cups.
