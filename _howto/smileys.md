You can type smileys (emoticons or emoji) in chats. There are two ways: automatic smileys and special characters.

### Automatic smileys
The easy way is to type punctuation that 7 Cups converts into a smiley automatically.

Because these smileys are supported by 7 Cups, they almost always work.

For example, if you type `:)` you get ![Smile](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/smile.png 'Smile').

You can only get 15 smileys this way. They are:

|Confused   |`o.O` |![Confused](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/confused.png 'Confused')  |
|Crying     |`:'(` |![Crying](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/crying.png 'Crying')  |
|Evil       |`3:)` |![Evil](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/evil.png 'Evil')  |
|Gasp       |`:O`  |![Gasp](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/gasp.png 'Gasp')  |
|Glasses    |`8)`  |![Glasses](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/glasses.png 'Glasses')  |
|Grin       |`:D`  |![Grin](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/grin.png 'Grin')  |
|Heart      |`<3`  |![Heart](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/heart.png 'Heart')  |
|Kiss       |`:*`  |![Kiss](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/kiss.png 'Kiss')  |
|Sad        |`:(`  |![Sad](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/sad.png 'Sad')  |
|Smile      |`:)`  |![Smile](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/smile.png 'Smile')  |
|Sour       |`>:(` |![Sour](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/sour.png 'Sour')  |
|Sunglasses |`8|`  |![Sunglasses](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/sunglasses_small.png 'Sunglasses')  |
|Tongue     |`:P`  |![Tongue](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/tongue.png 'Tongue')  |
|Unsure     |`:\`  |![Unsure](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/unsure.png 'Unsure')  |
|Wink       |`;)`  |![Wink](https://d37v7cqg82mgxu.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/wink.png 'Wink')  |

Some of these can be typed in alternative ways, but the alternatives are not shown here.

### Special characters
The other way is to type a special character, for example: â˜º

There are various ways to type special characters:

- Your mobile device might provide a special keyboard or popup where you can choose smiley characters.
- You can copy and paste smiley characters from some websites.
- On a computer you can copy and paste smiley characters from the character map.

Because 7 Cups does not support these special characters, they might or might not work. The person you are chatting to might see a different smiley from the one you see, or they might just see a square or nothing at all. Even when special characters work, they don't always look good on everyone's screen.

However, if you are lucky and they work for the person you are chatting to, they offer a much larger choice.
