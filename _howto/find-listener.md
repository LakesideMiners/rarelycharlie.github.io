title: Find a good listener

You can find listeners who have received good ratings from other people by searching for listeners who have certain badges. Here's a list. Click on the name of a badge to search for listeners who have that badge.

A large number in the Ratings column means the listeners are more experienced, but they are not necessarily any better.

A large number in the Listeners column means you have more listeners to choose from, and a better chance of finding a listener who can chat to you right now.

| Name of badge                                                          | Ratings | Listeners |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------:|----------:|
| [Verified](https://www.7cups.com/BrowseListeners/?badge=121)           | 2       | 5,500     |
| [Jester of Smiles](https://www.7cups.com/BrowseListeners/?badge=65)    | 10      | 19,000    |
| [Clerk of Bear Hugs](https://www.7cups.com/BrowseListeners/?badge=66)  | 25      | 6,500     |
| [Piper of Dedication](https://www.7cups.com/BrowseListeners/?badge=67) | 50      | 2,000     |
| [Baron of Big-Hearts](https://www.7cups.com/BrowseListeners/?badge=68) | 100     | 500       |
| [Knight of Smilehood](https://www.7cups.com/BrowseListeners/?badge=69) | 200     | 100       |

The Verified Listener badge requires one good review by a listener and at least one good written review by a member or guest. The other badges in the table require 4-star or 5-star ratings by members and guests.

Possibly the best way to find a good listener is to click on Jester of Smiles in the table. These listeners have at least 10 good ratings, and there are 19,000 of them to choose from.

Once a listener has earned the Jester of Smiles badge, they can earn the other badges in the table if they just keep going for long enough. It's not certain that they become any better at listening.
