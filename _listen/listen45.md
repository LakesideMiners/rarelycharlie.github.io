The most difficult subjects to chat with members about are the subjects you know a lot about yourself.

Your knowledge will make it very tempting for you to stop listening and give advice or try to solve the member's problems. It's important to remember that your role as a listener is to provide emotional support, not to give advice or solve problems.

To remain effective as a listener when the subject of the conversation is familiar to you, remind yourself that the member is a different person in a different situation. Your task is to understand and support that person in that situation, not to re-live your own situation.

Member: *“I yelled and screamed at him for maybe an hour, until I was exhausted. Yelling at him has no effect at all.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You were furious, but he takes no notice of how you feel.”*

After the quiz, we'll look at some other kinds of difficult subjects.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“Most people hate me because of the stigma around my disability. I wouldn't say I have any friends I can really trust not to let me down. It's just that right at this moment all my friends have let me down at the same time. I'm left with no one while they're all having a great time. Have you any advice?”*
