7 Cups does not provide an easy and reliable way to link to threads or posts in the forum.

For information on how to link manually, see: [Link to forums](/forumlink)

This guide tells you how to link to forums easily using the *Forum Links* script.

### Who can use Forum Links?
You can probably use Forum Links if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on a computer.

You might be able to use Forum Links if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on an Android device.

You cannot use Forum Links on an Apple iOS device.

You cannot use Forum Links if you use the 7 Cups App on any kind of device.

### What you need
To use Forum Links, you need to install two things in this order:

1. First install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in your web browser.

   If your web browser is not compatible with Tampermonkey, then you probably cannot proceed with the next step. However, at [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en) you can find some information about alternatives to Tampermonkey.

2. Next, install the [Forum Links](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/406937-7-cups-forum-links) script.

To install each of these in turn, click the relevant link and follow the instructions.

### Linking to threads
To link to the first page of a thread, copy the link shown at the top of the thread:

![Link at top of thread](/assets/forumlink0.png)

This links to the first page of the thread even in future when the thread might have many pages.

### Linking to posts
To link to a post, copy the link shown at the top right of the post:

![Link at top right of post](/assets/forumlink1.png)

### Linked posts
Forum Links fixes a 7 Cups bug that hides the top of a linked post underneath the navigation bar at the top of the page.

### Known issues

 - None

### Removing Forum Links
If you want to remove Forum Links, you can temporarily disable the script or you can delete it. You can also disable or delete Tampermonkey.

### Feedback

Please do not send feedback about this unofficial feature to 7 Cups, because they will be unable to act on it.
