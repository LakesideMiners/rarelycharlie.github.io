You can publicize 7 Cups on the Internet and in the real world.

For some information about publicizing 7 Cups on the Internet, see: [Howto: Get referral clicks](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/howto/referral-clicks)

For some more resources, including a flyer that you can print and use in the real world, the official source is the page: [Link to Us](https://www.7cups.com/about/linktous.php) However, the resources on that page are out of date.

You can download an updated (but unofficial) flyer from these links. There are two links because US (letter) and European (A4) paper sizes are slightly different.
