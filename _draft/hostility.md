# Part I
{:.part}

This is an unofficial training guide for listeners about chats with members who appear hostile.

This is not a self-help guide for members. If you are not a listener you can still read this guide, but becoming a listener first and gaining some experience taking general requests is strongly recommended as a starting point.

The guide is in many short sections. Most sections have a quiz at the end. You must correctly complete the quiz before you can move to the next section. There is no limit to the number of times you can retry each quiz.

To navigate back to a section you have completed, use the little square links along the top of each page.

**Trigger warning**: Research shows that trigger warnings have no value. Note, however, that if you continue with this guide you will come across fictitious examples of chats with members who appear hostile, possibly including examples of apparently political, sexual, racist, threatening, bullying and other extreme statements. If you have reason to be certain this is going to upset you, don't continue.

# What this guide is for

This guide provides information and guidance for those listeners who are willing to chat with members who appear hostile.

7 Cups does not require listeners to chat with any member who appears hostile. If you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, you can transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both. However, by applying the principles in this guide you might never have to transfer or block anyone.

Hostility in this guide includes hostility to the listener as well as to the member themselves and to other people, in the past, present and future, including hostility towards vulnerable people such as children, and hostility that is a criminal offense.

The goals of this guide are to help ensure that, in the context of chats with members who appear hostile:

- Listeners understand the purpose and limitations of 7 Cups.
- Listeners understand how to care for themselves.
- Listeners do not mistakenly give a “green light” to harmful behaviors.
- Listeners have an understanding of the reasons some members may appear hostile.
- Listeners can continue to apply the principles of active listening effectively when members appear hostile.

Some of the early sections of this guide overlap considerably with other guides, because they contain important information that underpins the later sections.

Part I of this guide outlines general principles, and Part II is about applying the princuiples in some particular cases.

The next section is a reminder about the purpose of 7 Cups.


# The purpose of 7 Cups

7 Cups exists because there is an unmet need in the world for emotional support:

>Our Goal: We are living in a world with an immense love deficit, which means that none of us is receiving the love we need to reach our true potential, to truly thrive. Our goal is to build a support system, a web, that can hold every member of our world. We believe that we can fill that love-gap for every person in the world, either because they are an active member of our community or because they are touched personally by someone who has been empowered by 7 Cups of Tea.

from [Our Mission](https://www.7cups.com/forum/GlensNook_84/OurVisionforaBetterWorld_334/OurMission_18219/1/)
{:.right}

7 Cups has values that describe how we relate to people. The values were altered and now make less sense than our original values, which included:

>We do not judge or look down on people. We recognize that people make sense in the larger context or story of their lives. Sometimes it can seem like people are making choices that do not make sense, but this is likely because we do not have all of the details. We understand that people are complicated and that life is not simple or easy.

from [Our Key Values](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164036/https://www.7cups.com/about/values.php) (archived)
{:.right}

### Limitations
However, 7 Cups imposes general limitations on the emotional support its listeners provide. If a member clearly says they are actively and seriously harming themselves or someone else, refer the member to 7 Cups' Crisis page ([`7cups.com/crisis`](https://www.7cups.com/crisis)). It is generally felt at 7 Cups that you cannot continue the chat when this happens.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe1.png){:.decor}

It is important to be aware that the word “actively” means “taking action”. A thought or fantasy is not an action. Planning to take action is not the same as taking action. For more information on this, there is a spearate guide: [Harm](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/guide/harm)

For example, someone might have thoughts about planting an apple tree and growing their own apples. They might clearly imagine the variety of apple and where they're going to plant it. But these things are not the same as preparing the gound and buying the tree. There’s an essential difference between thoughts and actions.

Members who appear hostile are expressing their hostile thoughts. Thoughts of this kind are not actions, and they are not a real-world threat.

Even so, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat because it appears hostile or for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both. In this guide, the phrase "very uncomfortable" means that your discomfort is so great that it crosses some boundary that only you can determine.

After the quiz, the next section is a further reminder about caring for yourself.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- You can only attempt this quiz three times.# You can attempt all the quizzes as many times as you need.
- At 7 Cups there are no limitations on what members can chat about.# At 7 Cups members cannot chat about seriously harming themselves or other people.
- The word "actively" means making definite plans to do something.# Actively means taking action.
- 7 Cups' goal is to meet everyone's need for emotional support.#It's to support everyone to thrive and reach their potential.
- 7 Cups' goal is to support all those people in the world who meet the high standards of our community.# Our goal is to support every person in the world.
- This guide is for members who need to learn how to be less hostile.# This guide is for listeners.
- This guide is in four parts.# It's in two parts.
- 7 Cups' values have changed since they were first published.#They were rewritten and are now very different.
- Members who appear hostile are expressing hostile thoughts.#Their thoughts are hostile, so they appear hostile.
- Members who appear hostile will eventually become violent.# Expressing hostile thoughts is not a real-world threat.
- Listeners can transfer chats to other listeners.#Listeners can transfer any chat that makes them very uncomfortable.
- Listeners are allowed to block members.#A listener can block a member if the listener becomes very uncomfortable in a chat.

# Self care
7 Cups very strongly encourages you to care for yourself as a priority at all times.

Note that the Listener Oath currently contradicts this. However, this guide assumes that listeners reading it have the good sense to disregard that part of the oath.

### Boundaries
You should think about your personal boundaries, and make decisions in advance about the kinds of chats you are personally willing to take. This includes decisions about chats that appear hostile.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe6.png){:.decor}

You have to make these decisions in advance, as far as possible, because a chat that starts out being about one subject can very quickly change to some other subject. You will need to be able to take action to protect yourself immediately there’s a change of subject that goes beyond your personal boundaries.

If you haven’t already done so, take a few minutes right now to list the topics of conversation that lie outside your personal boundaries. You could write the list in your secure [Notes](https://www.7cups.com/notes.php). (The link provided here works for any listener, provided you are logged in to 7 Cups.) Check your list from time to time to remind yourself of it, and also to keep it updated.

It’s also OK to be willing to chat about any topic without restriction. In this case you don’t need any list. But you should still make the decision not to have any list thoughtfully and in advance.

One of the boundaries that you have to decide on is how much discomfort you are prepared to accept in a chat. This might depend on how you are feeling generally on the day, and it's not an exact thing. Many chats create a certain tolerable amout of discomfort. In this guide, the phrase "very uncomfortable" means however much discomfort you decide, at the time, makes you unable to continue a chat.

It's OK to be willing to chat to members who appear hostile, or to members who appear hostile in some ways but not others. Appearing hostile is not a real-world threat.

It's OK to be willing to chat with a member when the chat makes you uncomfortable. Some members are very disturbed, severely mentally ill, or experience extreme situations, and it's expected that you will have some level of discomfort in chats with these members. However, it's entirely up to you how much discomfort you are prepared to accept.

### When your boundaries are crossed
When a chat goes beyond your personal boundaries, consider handing it over to another listener who has different boundaries. This includes when a chat simply makes you very uncomfortable. It's up to you how much discomfort you're prepared to accept.

For more information, see: [Transfer a chat to another listener](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/howto/transfer)

### After a difficult chat
After a chat that oversteps your personal boundaries, consider chatting to a peer supporter or a mentor about your own feelings. This is particularly important if your feelings persist or if you find yourself thinking about the chat long afterwards.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe5.png){:.decor}

If a chat affects you emotionally, and this in turn affects your real-life relationships or your ability to live your life normally, do not hesitate to switch to your member account and chat with an experienced listener about what happened and how it affected you. If you have a therapist or someone else in the real world you rely on for emotional support, be open with them about the effect volunteering as a listener at 7 Cups has on you, but do not share any details of any chat.

### Breaks
Take a break from listening any time you feel you need to. Indicate in your profile that you are on a break, or suspend your account completely. It's OK to take a break from 1-to-1 chats but continue to be involved at 7 Cups in other ways.

### Recovery
From time to time you might need to recover from an adverse experience as a listener. Adverse experiences can include being triggered, being wrongly accused, being drawn into a hostile situation, being bullied, and being made to feel you've failed in some way.

The first step to recovery is recognizing that something bad happened to you and you need to recover from it. If you just deny that anything happened, or try to distract yourself from it, then recovery is often more difficult and you might be more vulnerable to further adverse experiences.

It's often useful to take a break from listening, or a partial break, as a way of being kind to yourself. Taking a break does not signal to bullies or accusers that they have won. It signals that you can take care of yourself and they can't stop you.

When you're upset after something bad happened, it's useful to think about evidence for it being *temporary*, *universal* and *external*. Research shows that people who are good at thinking of adverse experiences as temporary, universal and external recover faster and more completely:

- *temporary*: "That was a one-off. Things like that are rare."
- *universal*: "Things like that can happen to any listener."
- *external*: "That didn't reflect on me personally. It happened because of someone or something else."

After the quiz, the next section is a reminder about active listening.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Listeners should be clear about their personal boundaries.#Listeners are not required to take chats that violate their boundaries.
- Listeners must not chat to members about any hostile thoughts that members might have.# It's OK for listeners to be willing to chat about any topic without restriction.
- Listeners must never continue a chat if they become uncomfortable.# It's OK to be willing to chat with a member when the chat makes you uncomfortable.

- Listeners can take notes and keep them secure at 7 Cups.#Listeners' notes at 7 Cups are secure.
- A listener can transfer a chat to another listener.#Listeners whose personal boundaries do not allow them to continue a chat can transfer it.
- Listeners must not tolerate any level of discomfort, because some members are mentally ill.# Listeners must expect a certain amount of discomfort when chatting to severely disturbed members.
- One goal of this guide is to help listeners give a "green light" to members' desired behaviours.# Listeners must not give a "green light" to harmful behaviours.
- Listeners must never block members, because at 7 Cups members are entitled to emotional support.# Listeners can block members they would feel very uncomfortable chatting to.
- At 7 Cups we look down on people who cannot control their hostility.# At 7 Cups we do not look down on anyone. This was one of our original values.
- Fantasies always end up being acted out in real life.# Fantasies are thoughts, not actions.
- Listeners are not allowed to block members because members' emotional needs come first.# Listeners can block members who cause them to feel very uncomfortable.
- Sometimes listeners are wrongly accused, and after this happens they might need to recover.#Being wrongly accused is one of the adverse events that can happen to listeners.
- Thinking of adverse events as temporary, universal and external helps you recover from them.#Research shows that this way of thinking helps recovery.

# Brief active listening refresher
This guide assumes you are still familiar with the initial listener training. Here’s a selection of exact quotes as reminders:

- “Keep in mind that active listening is not counseling or advice giving.”
- “You shouldn’t try to solve their problems.”
- “Repeat back to the person the facts that they have just shared.”
- “Don’t add questions, commentary, or suggestions.”
- “Repeat back expressed emotions.”
- “Avoid making assumptions.”
- “It is important to not break confidentiality.”
- “Don’t hesitate to refer the person if they have needs that extend beyond listening.”
- “The primary reason we allow anonymity is because it allows people to seek help without fear of being judged.”
- “Being triggered is a normal part of life.”
- “Report inappropriate behavior.”

If any of these seem unfamiliar, take a few minutes right now to review the official Active Listening guide before returning to this guide.

### Emotional support
The way listeners at 7 Cups provide emotional support is through active listening, allowing people to feel heard. Emotional support has a particular focus on feelings. The goal is to allow people to express their feelings and to know that their feelings have been heard.

Realistically, life is not simple or easy. People have both positive and negative emotions in response to the events of their lives. Listeners should allow both the positive emotions and the negative emotions to be heard equally.

In response to situations that make people feel threatened, they naturally have negative emotions that can appear hostile. Listeners at 7 Cups allow people’s negative emotions, including their hostility, to be heard.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe7.png){:.decor}

Do not try to suppress members’ negative emotions or supply positive emotions. If you do that, you might neutralize a member’s natural negative emotions in response to the things that threaten them, allowing the threat to continue.

For example, if a member appears hostile because of a threat, repeat back the feeling of threat they have expressed, just like the listener training says. Do not neutralize the threat or change the subject to something positive—doing that risks giving a “green light” to the member's hostile reaction.

|Member:|Don't f\*cking give me that cr\*p about not being able to give advice. I f\*cking need to know what to do about my son. Will you tell me or won't you? You'd better watch out if you don't help me with this. I'll come after you and make your life h\*ll.
|Listener:|Everything depends on finding out what you can do for your son. It's driving you frantic that no one can simply tell you the answer.

# The chat system
The chat system at 7 Cups has some features that help listeners to control the chats they take.

### Personal requests
Manage your status (in the website) by clicking on your own profile picture at the top right of almost any page. Choose an appropriate status from the menu:

<style>i.fa-circle {display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px 0 1em;}</style>
<i class="fa fa-circle" style="color: #5cb85c;"></i>Online: prepared to accept personal requests\\
<i class="fa fa-circle" style="color: #d9534f;"></i>Offline: no personal requests\\
<i class="fa fa-circle" style="color: #ff7900;"></i>Busy: no personal requests

Your status is automatically set to Offline when you are logged out, but it's reset to what it was when you log back in.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe0.png){:.decor}

There's effectively no difference between Offline and Busy. Don't set your status to Online unless you really are prepared to accept personal requests.

It's OK to set your status to Offline and never change it. You can still chat to members and do everything else.

If your status is Online and you receive a personal request, you are *expected* to accept the request and chat to the member.

If you feel you are at risk from members who appear hostile, never set your status to Online, so that you can never get personal requests.

### Unexpected messages
On the page where your growth path is shown, a chat list shows the members you have chatted to recently.

If a member you've never chatted to before sends you an unexpected message while your status is Offline or Busy, a chat starts automatically and the member appears in your chat list. You can go into the chat to read the message but you are not obliged to respond, because you were Offline or Busy when the member sent the message. The member will not know you read the message.

<style>.fa-times {height: 14px; width: 14px; display: inline-block; background: #bbb; padding: 4px; color: #fff; font-size: 14px; border-radius: 50%; text-align: center;}</style>
If you decide not to respond to an unexpected message, you can hide the chat by clicking its <i class="fa fa-times" title="Hide this user, will re-appear when you receive a message."></i> symbol in your chat list. If the member sends another message the chat will reappear, and you can hide it again or block the member.

A member who wants to chat with you in particular should wait until your status is Online, then send you a personal request (by using the Chat Now button in your profile). You do not have to chat to members if you have never chatted to them before and they send you unexpected messages.

If you have chatted to a member in the past, you didn't block them, and they send you an unexpected message, then you *should* always respond to the member as soon as you can.

If you make a decision never to respond to unexpected messages, it's helpful to mention this in your profile. If you make a decision never to allow personal requests, it's helpful to mention this too.

### Evidence of inappropriate chats
7 Cups does not provide a way to record evidence of an inappropriate chat. You're on your own with this.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom7.png){:.decol}

Find out how to capture a screenshot (an image of your screen) on your device. When a possibly inappropriate situation arises in a chat, capture a screenshot immediately. If possible, save the screenshot in a secure place where no one else can see it.

If you need to send a screenshot to 7 Cups as evidence in support of a report, upload the screenshot to [Imgur](https://imgur.com). Ensure that you are not logged in to an Imgur account, so that the upload is anonymous. Provide the screenshot's Imgur URL in your report. This process is not completely secure but it's the best that 7 Cups has come up with.

You can use some other image sharing website if it allows anonymous uploads. Do not use a site where you have to log in, because images could be traced back to your account.

### Reporting
When you block or ban a member, the reason you provide is submitted as a report. There is no need to make a further report.

There's a secondary report form here: [Report Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffQk1RhknozmquuEYiE_fZDp2ynNz-VB4XXBbRrrKmV57V5w/viewform)

To find 7 Cups' general reporting page, use the [Support & Feedback](https://help.7cups.com/) link at the bottom of most pages. To provide this link to someone in a chat, write: `help.7cups.com` The Submit a request link is at the top right of that page. You can submit a request to make any kind of report.

And you can report a member by e-mail, from the address you use to log in to 7 Cups, to `community@7cups.com`

No one really knows why there are four different ways to do the same thing.

After the quiz, the next section explores hostile language.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Listeners should be clear about their personal boundaries.#Listeners are not required to take chats that violate their boundaries.
- A member is automatically notified when a listener reads their message.# Members do not know that you have read any message they sent, unless you choose to respond.
- Listeners can temporarily hide the chats in their chat list.#Hidden chats reappear when another message arrives.
- A listener who gets an unexpected message from a member they have never chatted to must respond to the message as soon as possible.# There is no obligation to respond, because the listener must have been Offline or Busy.
- Listeners must never use screenshots or any other means of recording chats, because confidentiality is required at all times.# Screenshots are allowed as evidence to send to 7 Cups, even though they are not completely secure.
- A listener whose status is Busy will never get personal requests.#Busy status prevents personal requests.
- A listener whose status is Offline must change it to Online if they want to take any chats.# While Offline you can still chat to members and do everything else.
- A listener whose status is Online should be prepared to accept personal requests.#That's what Online means.
- A listener can use a screenshot as evidence of what happened in a chat.#Screenshots are the only evidence 7 Cups uses.
- Listeners can report members.#Listeners can submit a report when blocking or banning a member, or in other ways.
- When a member chats to a listener, the member must be prepared to accept the listener's judgement of the situation.# Listeners must not judge.
- Listeners can assume that when a member becomes hostile during a chat it must be the listener's fault.# Listeners should avoid making assumptions.

# Hostile language
When a member appears hostile, it's because they've said something that appears hostile, even though there is no real-world threat. It can be useful to consider carefully how this works.

### Words
Language works because words create patterns of thought, but the pattern of thought created by any one word or phrase depends on the context of other words around it.

In an extreme example, a box labelled with the word *Gift* contains a present if it's in English, but it contains poison if it's in German. Gift means different things in English and German contexts.

Lewis Carroll's poem *Jabberwocky* is another example. Here's the first verse:

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 2em;"></span>And the mome raths outgrabe.
{:style="width: 50%; margin-left: 2em;"}

To make any sense of this you have to kind of let go of the fact that many of the words are nonsense. You could stop reading when you get to brillig and just refuse to read any further, for the simple reason that brillig isn't a real word, but to do that would be to miss the point of the poem.

The entire poem is full of nonsense but it tells a story anyway. You can read it here: [Jabberwocky](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky)

In the same author's book, *Through the Looking Glass*, the character Humpty Dumpty explains:

>‘Brillig’ means four o’clock in the afternoon—the time when you begin broiling things for dinner.

This is also nonsense—there's still no such word as brillig. In fact there's no such person as Humpty Dumpty.

The lesson from this is that you can read the poem and get a sense of what it means by mentally sliding over words like brillig, whether or not you believe Humpty Dumpty's opinion of what it means.

### Hostility
Hostile language is the same.

You might have a strong sense that a member is saying hostile things, because you know what the words mean and taken all together in context they convey a definite sense of hostility.

But you can also kind of let go of the fact that the words mean hostile things, in order to get at the meaning behind the words. For example, a member says:

|Member:|You're a crap listener. I've never had such bad advice.|
{:.chat}

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom0.png){:.decol}

You could stop reading when you get to crap and just refuse to read any further, for the simple reason that crap is a hostile word, but to do that would be to miss the point of the message, which is that the member wants you to know they feel the chat has gone very badly.

The lesson from this is that you can read the message and get a sense of what it means by mentally sliding over words like crap. Doing that helps you to reflect the member's feelings and ensure that the member is heard, valued and understood:

|Listener:|This chat hasn't helped you at all.|
{:.chat}

After the quiz, the next section looks at the chat censor.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- A listener who receives a hostile message can record it as a screenshot.#This is the only recommended way to record the evidence.
- A listener who is logged out can never get hostile messages.# Members can send unexpected messages anyway.
- Listeners should have personal boundaries.#Listeners should think carefully in advance about their personal boundaries.
- Members who are triggered and become hostile should be referred to their local emergency services.# Being triggered is a normal part of life.
- Listeners should be careful to care for themselves except when a hostile member urgently needs to be dealt with.# Listeners should care for themselves at all times.
- When a member appears to be hostile, a listener should give carefully thought out advice on better ways to communicate.# Listeners do not give advice.
- You must always block a member who uses a word like crap.# Only block a member if the chat makes you so very uncomfortable that you could never chat to them again.
- As a listener you don't always have to take hostile words literally.#You can slide over hostile words to get a sense of the meaning.
- Some words mean different things depending on the context.#The meanings of words can be very different in different contexts.
- When a member sends a hostile message, you should follow your first instinct because considering it carefully is never useful.# It can be useful to consider hostile messages carefully.
- When a member appears hostile, there is always a very real threat of violence.# There is no real-world threat.
- Words you read create patterns of thought.#That's the way language works.
- After an adverse event occurs, it is helpful to tell yourself the event was trivial, unimportant and minor.# It is helpful to think of the reasons why it was temporary, universal and external to you.

# The chat censor
Every message in every chat, chatroom and forum at 7 Cups is monitored by software known as the censor. The censor blocks entire messages or posts if they contain certain phrases that could upset some people.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe4.png){:.decor}

In chats and chatrooms, the censor also blocks certain individual words. In this case the words are replaced by asterisks, <span style="font-family: 'Work Sans'; letter-spacing: -.2px;">***</span>, but the censor does not block the entire message.

The censor is badly implemented and erratic, blocking relatively harmless words and phrases while allowing some very offensive language. A member who wants to appear hostile will have no difficulty evading the censor, but a member who genuinely wishes to tell their story and express their feelings may become frustrated. They might feel rejected. They might feel shamed.

Although the censor does protect some vulnerable listeners, it is a form of stigma that also makes some difficult chats even more difficult for members. Members who are adversely affected by the censor might feel hostility, and their hostility might be directed at the listener (who has done nothing wrong, of course).

Listeners are not told when a member's message has been blocked. This means that a member might suddenly appear to become unresponsive or hostile because the censor has blocked one or more of their messages. They might abandon the chat and report you. They might threaten you.

### Consequences for listeners
There can be consequences for listeners who try to send messages that the censor blocks. Blocked messages are reported and evaluated out of context, because the rest of the chat is unavailable. Messages are sometimes misinterpreted, and listeners can sometimes receive official complaints by e-mail as a result.

When the censor blocks your message, keep a copy of the message and report the incident immediately by e-mail, from the address that you use to log in as a listener, to: community@7cups.com  Do not include details of the chat, but do include the blocked message (which did not become part of the chat) and explain why you wanted to send it.

### Evading the censor
![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe2.png){:.decor}

The complete lists of censored words and phrases are public but their location is not widely known. The lists are updated from time to time. There is no need for anyone to memorize the lists in order to evade the censor, because it is easy to disguise obvious trigger words. However, some triggers are not obvious.

For example, at the time of writing a member cannot say, "My uncle lives in a skyscraper on the 43rd floor." The member will have a hard time figuring out which word to disguise. In fact it's skyscraper, which contains the letters KYS. 7 Cups has decided that KYS might be interpreted to mean "Kill yourself." After a few tries the member might figure out a way to evade the censor:

|Member:|My uncle lives in a sky scraper on the 43rd floor.|
{:.chat}

The example chats in this guide have been cleared with the censor at the time of writing, but some of them would activate the censor if they were reworded only slightly, and the censor might change at any time without warning. The text of this guide contains words and phreases that 7 Cups would censor.

In this example the listener was reported, and then retyped the message with an accent on the letter i to evade the censor:

|Member:|I suppose you think I'm stupid.
|Listener:|*\[message blocked\]*
|Listener:|No, I don't think you are stupíd!

In this example the member was blocked the first time, but not the second time, for accurately reporting what was said by someone else:

# Part II
{:.part}

Part II of this guide goes into more detail about some reasons members might appear hostile, with brief examples.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decob1.png){:.decoc}



# Appearances

In this guide the phrase "appear hostile" is used because listeners cannot judge whether a member who uses language in ways that seem hostile can really be taken literally. For example, a member says to a listener:

|Member:|You need to be very careful. I'm going to get you.
{:.chat}

This seems threatening, but there is no real-world threat. For one thing, at 7 Cups no one knows who you are.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom6.png){:.decol}

Even you are one of those rare listeners who uses their real name and photo on 7 Cups, a threat like this is still not a credible risk to your real-world safety.

So this kind of message only tells you something about the member's current state of mind. A listener's task is to provide emotional support by ensuring that the member is heard, valued and understood, and their state of mind is exactly what you should respond to.

You might respond to a message like this by trying to reflect the member's feelings in any number of ways, for example:

|Listener:|It's like you want it to be known that you're dangerous.
{:.chat}

It's pointless reflecting the imaginary threat. Doing that would make it seem more real to the member and give it a "green light". And it's pointless taking the statement personally. Your reply should keep the focus of the chat on emotionally supporting the member in a non-judgemental way.

It's also important not to get into a kind of role-playing game in which the member plays oppressor and you play victim, not even if you enjoy games of that kind in other circumstances. Playing games is not what 7 Cups is for.

### Why members appear hostile
Members can appear hostile for a variety of reasons. The following sections will describe some of the common ones.

Listeners cannot play at being therapists, diagnose mental illness, or make judgements about members' motives, so this guide must not be used to try and diagnose or treat any member.

For example, a listener might privately think, "Hmmm, this member seems psychotic", and thinking that might be helpful in making sense of the member's messages, but it would never be useful to share that private thought with a member who appears hostile.

|Member:|I haven't slept well for 12 years. The people in the shadows are always muttering. All night it goes on. You so-called listeners don't know anything. You're f*ck*ng useless.
||*Listener thinks, "Hmmm, this member seems psychotic."*
|Listener:|Like you can't hear anything clearly but it keeps you awake anyway.
{:.chat}

Notice that this listener doesn't either agree or disagree that there are people in the shadows muttering all night.

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.

After the quiz, the next section considers social cues.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Experienced listeners can always judge whether a member's hostility is real.# Listeners cannot judge.
- When a member appears to be threatening, there is no real-world threat.#No one knows who you are, so you cannot really be under threat.
- What members say in chats is an indication of their state of mind.#Messages from members reveal their state of mind, which listeners then reflect back.
- Listeners must take all personal threats extremely seriously.# There is never any real-world threat.
- Listeners must not validate members' hostile thoughts, because that would be like giving them a "green light".#Listeners should not make members' imaginary hostility seem real.
- If a member wants to play the part of an oppresser, a listener must agree to play the victim in order to provide the member with good support.# Playing games is not what 7 Cups is for.
- Experienced listeners can use the techniques of psychotherapy to judge members' mental states accurately.# Listeners must not play at being therapists, and they cannot judge members.
- When a listener diagnosis psychosis in a member, it's important for the listener to tell the member immediately so they can get urgent psychiatric help.# Listeners cannot diagnose.
- A listener who becomes very uncomfortable in a chat can transfer the chat to some other listener.#Listeners can always transfer chats that make them too uncomfortable.
- A listener who is triggered by the things a member is saying must arrange to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible.# Being triggered is a normal part of life.
- A listener must never simply repeat back any emotions a member expresses, but should always try to offer a compassionate and caring solution to the problem.# Listeners should repeat back emotions, and listeners do not solve problems.
- An automatic chat censor accurately detects hostile messages and protects vulnerable listeners.# The chat censor is inaccurate and provides no protection.
{:.quiz}


# Misread social cues

Some members misread social cues and communicate in ways that a listener might be unfamiliar with and misinterpret.

For example, in many social contexts the word fuck is commonplace and completely harmless. As a result, members will often use it in chats:

|Listener:|I'm sorry, I'll have to go in about 10 minutes. Will you be OK?
|Member:|Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!!!
{:.chat}

This member is expressing frustration but not being hostile.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom1.png){:.decol}

In a way this is similar to the situation with members who are not writing in their first language, or who are dyslexic, and who might use language in ways you find unusual. Listeners must simply accept this. 7 Cups is not a language school, and 7 Cups is not an academy of social etiquette.

You should normally try to reply in standard language without using any recent abbreviations or slang that might be misunderstood. However, there is no need to try and adapt your own language to match the member's country or region.

The exception is that when a member tells you something important to them, you can demonstrate that you read their message by reflecting it using the member's exact words, even if you yourself would normally use different words:

|Member:|I hate him so much. I call him the ugly gay dwarf LOL
|Listener:|LOL! Does the ugly gay dwarf know you call him that?
|Member:|Noooooooooooo! He'd *** himself if he found out.
|Member:|sh*t
|Listener:|You're probably right. He'd probably shít himself.
{:.chat}

This member is expressing hostility to the person they hate so much. 7 Cups exists for people who need support with negative emotions, including hate.

Changing this member's words could give the impression that you lack empathy, but you will have to decide for yourself how comfortable you are using unfamiliar language, depending on the situation.

When a member's language is so far from your own experience of language that you don't understand what they mean, you can ask. But the intention is for members to feel heard, so this is not ideal.

When necessary, you can use [Urban Dictionary](https://urbandictionary.com){:target="\_blank"} or similar to look up unfamiliar slang. This will slow down your reply a little, but understanding what the member is trying to communicate is more important:

|Listener:|How was your trip to Florida?
|Member:|Total woftam
||*Listener looks it up: "waste of fucking time and money"*
|Listener:|You were so positive about it last time we chatted. What went wrong?
{:.chat}

This member is expressing some negativity about their recent trip, but not hostility.

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.

After the quiz, the next section describes anxious members.

- Listeners can make decisions in advance about the kinds of chats they are personally willing to take.#Doing this is recommended.

- 7 Cups exists because there is an unmet need in the world for emotional support.#That's the reason!
- Members must never express hate, and listeners should block any members who do.# Hate is a negative emotion, and 7 Cups provides emotional support without judgement.
- It's important for a listener to try and understand what a member means, even when the member's language is unfamiliar to the listener.#Listeners must demonstrate that the member has been heard and understood.

- Listeners' training in active listening ensures that they can never misinterpret a member's style of communication.# The training does not cover communication styles, and sometimes members can be misinterpreted.
{:.quiz}


# Anxiety
Some members suffer from an anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder. Listeners cannot diagnose this.

A common coping mechanism for people who suffer from anxiety is to become controlling. This happens because an anxious person cannot always identify the real source of their anxiety, so they try to eliminate all possible sources of anxiety by controlling them.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom5.png){:.decol}

This coping mechanism doesn't actually work, and in fact it often makes things worse, so it's something that therapists help their anxious clients to avoid. But listeners are not therapists, so you cannot help members in that way.

In a chat, a member doesn't quite know how you're going to respond to the things they're telling you. This uncertainty is a possible source of anxiety, so an anxious member might try to control you by giving you tasks.

A typical task is telling the member something personal about yourself, such as your age. The member doesn't really need to know your age. The member needs to know that they can control you.

|Member:|I need to know how old you are before I can chat to you.
{:.chat}

It is not part of your role as a listener to perform tasks for members, so you can't go along with being controlled. However, providing some reassurance that the member can relate to you as a human being is also valuable, so it's often a matter of judgement.

It is certainly OK to give members personal information that's already in your profile or in your 7 Cups diary (if you have one). For other personal information it's useful if you can decide in advance what you're willing to disclose and what you want to keep hidden. Never provide information that could identify you or allow you to be contacted outside 7 Cups.

Refusing to perform a task will increase the member's anxiety, and apparent hostility might sometimes be the result. The member might succeed in making you feel bad, but it's important that you try to reflect the member's feeling in the usual way. Don't reflect your own feelings. The chat is not about you:

|Member:|I need you to message me every morning before 8 with a helpful quote.
|Listener:|I'm sorry I'm not able to do that, but on the days when I log in to 7 Cups I will always try to respond to your messages.
|Member:|What kind of a retard are you anyway? I just need a quote every day. Is that too much to ask? You need to be very careful. I'm going to get you.
|Listener:|You feel very strongly that you need someone in your life who will be reliable.
{:.chat}

This member is anxious and controlling, not hostile.

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.

After the quiz, the next section describes members who have been abused.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- It's important to obey members even if it makes you feel very uncomfortable, because a member might be suffering from anxiety.# Obeying members is not part of a listener's role. If you feel very uncomfortable, transfer the chat to another listener.

- Listeners must learn to diagnose anxiety, because anxious members can appear hostile.# Listeners do not diagnose.
{:.quiz}


# Abuse
Some members are suffering abuse, or they have suffered abuse in the past. They might feel understandable hosility towards their abuser.

But the member might not be able to express their hostility directly. This might be because they fear retaliation, or because the abuse was in the past and the abuser is no longer available.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe0.png){:.decor}

In some cases an unconscious psychological mechanism called [*displacement*](http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/displacement.htm) can become activated in a situation like this. Displacement is when someone is prevented from expressing how they really feel towards someone, so instead they act out the behaviour towards someone else.

Displacement was first described by the psychoanalyst Anna Freud in her 1936 book *The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence*.

A typical example is when a man is bullied by his boss, but he can't fight back because the boss might fire him. So he goes home and starts a fight with his wife. She can't fight back because she fears her husband's anger, so she shouts at their son. The boy can't argue with his mother so he kicks the dog. None of them has any awareness of the displacement mechanism.

Because displacement is unconscious, the abused member who displaces their hostility on to a listener is not aware they are doing it. Their hostility to the listener feels real and justified to them.

For example, a member has a terrible boss, and she wishes she could report him, but she might lose her job. At 7 Cups she unconsciously displaces her feelings. As usual, a listener must try to reflect the member's feelings, not the listener's own feelings:

|Member:|You're the most uncaring and ignorant listener I've ever spoken to. I'm going to report you.
|Listener:|You want to feel cared for by someone who knows and understands your situation.
{:.chat}

This member is feeling hostile, and she believes her hostility is towards you because the displacement of her real hostility towards her uncaring and ignorant boss is unconscious.

As a listener you cannot play at being a psychoanalyst and diagnose unconscious mechanisms. You have to stick to doing what listeners do, and try to reflect the member's underlying feeling.

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.

After the quiz, the next section discusses fantasies.

- Listeners should always respond to messages from members they've chatted to in the past who return unexpectedly.#Responding to members' messages is expected when a previous chat restarts.
- A man who is being bullied by his boss is not entitled to listeners' support at 7 Cups, because victims of bullying do not need emotional support.# Victims of bullying do need emotional support.
- When a member has been abused in the past, they might feel hostility towards the abuser long after the abuser has gone.#Feelings of hostility can continue, and can be directed towards other people.
- When a listener judges that a member is being abused, the listener should try to come up with a solution that takes everyone's needs into account.# Listeners do not judge. Listeners do not try to solve problems.

{:.quiz}



# Fantasy

Some members use 7 Cups to share fantasies with listeners. As a listener, without realizing it at first, you can find yourself cast in a role in a member's imaginary drama.

The drama is sometimes pure fantasy, and sometimes it's based on a book, a TV show or a movie. People often have very extensive fantasies, and when they write them down we call those people authors. When they write fantasies based on well-known books, TV shows or movies we call them fan-fiction authors.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom2.png){:.decol}

At some level the member who does this is aware that the chat is based on a fantasy, and occasionally, if the fantasy comes to a conclusion or is challenged, the member will admit to it. But often the member refuses to admit to it, and a listener who challenges it will find themselves blocked.

When a member describes far-fetched or impossible situations as if they are real, a listener has to make a choice about whether to question the reality of the member's story. It's more comfortable for the listener to feel that they are listening to members who tell the absolute truth. And 7 Cups is not here so that members can tell themselves stories.

However, the emotional content of a fantasy might be true for the member even when the superficial details are false. For example, a member might feel shame telling a listener about their dysfunctional family, but spinning a yarn based on Star Trek might allow the same feelings to be explored in a fictional context that feels safer.

In general, if at all possible, it is better for members if they can share their emotions at 7 Cups in whatever way they feel most comfortable with. This means that listeners should refrain from fact-checking what members tell them and stick to active listening, reflecting the emotional content.

This is true even when the member's story is inconsistent or completely unbelieveable. The member might not be a skilled story-teller, but the emotional content of the chat is likey to be true in ways that the member really does need to share with someone.

However, a listener should not generally accept a role in a member's drama. It is better to remain detached, to observe the drama, and to reflect the emotional content without getting drawn in to the action.

|Member:|My dad is the captain of a merchant ship. He's away a lot because he travels such long distances. He's been at sea for 10 years. No contact with land for all that time. That's the kind of life I want to live one day. To me you are like the radio operator on the ship, and you can get messages to the captain.
|Listener:|You want to live that life, with no contact for years and years like your dad. Do you mean there's something you want to tell him?
{:.chat}

In this chat the member assigns an absurd role to the listener, but the listener doesn't either accept the role or challenge the absurdity. Instead, the listener tries to reflect the member's feelings.

### Porn

A lot of published commercial fantasy, and amateur fantasy too, is porn, and a proportion is extreme and violent. When the listener's role in a fantasy is a victim role, the fantasy will appear hostile:

|Member:|You are my slave and you will call me Sir. Otherwise I will rape you and beat you.
|Listener:|Like you want to feel superior?
{:.chat}

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom4.png){:.decol}

This member is apparently hostile and threatening, but there is no real-life threat and the listener can try to reflect the member's feelings without accepting a victim role.

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.

After the quiz, the next section is about delusions.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- At 7 Cups everything members say is true.# Members sometimes use 7 Cups to share fantasies, or say things that are not true for other reasons.
- Sometimes members use chats to act out imaginary dramas.#Listeners can find themselves cast in a role.
- When a member says something that cannot possibly be true, the member's feelings might be genuine.#Members sometimes express real feelings as fantasy.
- 7 Cups is here to provide emotional support, not to judge the truth of what members say.#Emotional support is the purpose of 7 Cups, and listener cannot judge.
- Listeners must be careful to judge whether what members tell them is true of false.# Listeners do not judge.
- When a member is fantasizing in a chat, the listener must be particularly careful to give practical advice, because this will help the member to stop fantasizing.# Listeners do not give advice.
- Listeners should not accept roles in members' imaginary dramas.#Listeners should reflect members' feelings while remaining detached.
- Members whose fantasies are based on porn must be reported and banned immediately.# Listeners can choose which topics they are willing to chat about, and transfer any chat to another listener if it makes the listener very uncomfortable.
- Some members' stories are inconsistent.#Members are not required to be consistenet. Life is complicated.
- Some members want listeners to play victim while they play oppressor.#Members have all kinds of fantasies, but listeners should remain detached.

- Members sometimes become hostile to listeners who don't obey them.#TMembers can react by becoming hostile, although there is no real-life threat.
- A listener who has a therapist can ask their therapist to analyse the listener's most difficult chats and suggest ways the listener can improve.# Chats are confidential.
- Planning to take some harmful action is effectively the same as taking action, because harm will always be the end result,# Planning is just thoughts.
{:.quiz}



# Delusions

Sometimes a member has a mental illness that causes delusions, or is under the influence of a drug that causes an altered state of consciousness. Listeners cannot diagnose mental illness, substance abuse, or any other source of delusions.

For example, in a mental illness that involves psychosis, the member might have episodes in which perceptions similar to nightmares merge with everyday life. The member might or might not have awareness of what is real and what is a nightmare-like delusion.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decom3.png){:.decol}

And for example, in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) the member might have episodes, known as flashbacks, in which memories of past traumatic events are re-lived as if in the present.

These are only two examples. Altered states of consciousness, in which a member is not experiencing reality the way the rest of us do, can have many causes and it is not for a listener to make judgements about what the cause might be. Sometimes they are episodic, and the member returns to normal between episodes. Sometimes they are a permanent disability.

For a listener, the problem is that the member might incorporate the listener in some role within the member's altered reality. The effect can be the same as when a member displaces hostility or tries to involve you in a fantasy—as the listener you experience a hostile chat, and the member is unaware that you are not the person their hostility is really directed at.

Sometimes members are aware that they have delusions:

|Member:|Sometimes I see poisonous snakes that try to make me do evil things, but the snakes are not real.
{:.chat}

Sometimes they are unaware:

|Member:|I know you are a poisonous snake and you are trying to make me do evil things.
{:.chat}

Sometimes it's not so clear:

|Member:|My uncle is like a poisonous snake. He tries to make me do things that are evil.
{:.chat}

Listeners can provide emotional support without validating perceptions that may be delusional, but listeners cannot judge what's real and what's not—even the member often cannot judge:

|Member:|I know you and I know what you do. You are evil but I'm strong and I'm not frightened of you.
|Listener:|You have a sense of evil but you're not afraid because you're strong.
{:.chat}

This member appears hostile, but there's a sense of unreality about the accusation, and no real-world threat.

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.

After the quiz, the next section discusses stalkers.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Psychosis is a symptom of mental illness.#There are several mental illnesses that can involve psychosis.

# Stalkers
When a member comes to 7 Cups with certain emotional needs, but after a chat their needs have not been met, realistically they have three options.

- They have the option to give up and never return to 7 Cups. This is what some members do.

- They have the option to try another listener. This is what some members do. Every time they are rejected by a listener they simply move on to another listener.

- They have the option to persist with the same listener, becoming a stalker. This is what some members do. It's particularly likely if they have cast you to play a victim role in their drama and your attempts to escape become part of the role. Blocking this kind of member *reinforces* their perception of you as a victim, and makes it more likely they will become a stalker.

Unfortunately 7 Cups has always resisted making changes to the chat system that would protect listeners from this kind of stalker. It's not known why this is.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe3.png){:.decor}

A member who wants to make a new member account only requires another e-mail address, and 7 Cups accepts fake addresses and aliases, so a stalker simply doesn't mind being blocked or banned. Persistent stalkers frequently change their account and screen name.

With the chat system as it is, the only good response to an apparently hostile chat is to stick to active listening and try to provide emotional support. You might end up providing emotional support to horrible people you'd prefer didn't exist, but there isn't a way to rid the world of horrible people other than by doing our best to help them.

You have no obligation to respond to anyone with a new account who sends you an unexpected message while you are busy or offline. You can open the chat to read their message without them knowing. If you decide never to respond, you can hide the chat, although it will reappear if they message you again, and you'll have to hide it again.

Responding sympathetically to a hostile message might be interpreted as a "green light" for further hostility. It is better to remain detached and try to reflect the member's feelings accurately. Failing that, it is better not to respond at all.

So the suggested things to try if you get nothing but hostility in a chat are:

1. If you feel you can accurately reflect the member's feelings, try to provide emotional support in the normal way.
2. If you were trying to provide support but you can't any longer, try to transfer the chat to another listener, then block the member.
3. If the message is unexpected and from an account you have never chatted to before, consider hiding the chat and ignoring it.
4. If you decided to ignore unexpected messages, stick to your decision. The member will not even know you've seen the messages.

|<span style="display: inline-block; width: 10.5em;">Member account #1:</span>|F*ck you.
||*\[Listener doesn't respond.\]*
|Member account #2:|F*ck you.
||*\[Listener doesn't respond.\]*
|Member account #3:|F*ck you.
||*\[Listener doesn't respond.\]*
{:.chat}

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.

After the quiz, the next section is about narcissistic members.

- Mark each statement true or false:
- Stalkers on 7 Cups often use multiple accounts.#7 Cups makes it easy for stakers to create new accounts.
- Members who find their need for emotional support is not met sometimes give up and leave 7 Cups.#Sometimes they never return.

# Narcissism
Narcissism is a personality trait that comes from a very deep sense of inner emptiness and meaninglessness. It can range from mild to severe, and people with the most severe narcissism can be diagnosed as having narcissistic personality disorder. Listeners cannot diagnose narcissism or provide therapy for it.

The term personality trait means that narcissism alters the way the sufferer interacts with other people and the way other people think of them. It appears to affect their personality.

For a narcissist, the feeling of being empty and meaningless is shameful. Therefore it has to be hidden. A narcissist will not come right out and say how they really feel.

Narcissists typically try to hide their sense of emptiness with grandiose and arrogant self-belief. For example, most narcissists would never admit to needing any kind of emotional support. For that reason we never encounter typical narcissists as members at 7 Cups (although we might encounter them as listeners).

### Covert narcissism

However, there's another type of narcissist, known as a covert or closet narcissist, who hides their sense of emptiness by making it other people's responsibility. This type of narcissist might become a member at 7 Cups.

![decoration](/assets/hostile/decoe1.png){:.decor}

In a typical scenario, a narcissistic member feels life is empty and meaningless, but feels shame about how they feel. To avoid shame, the member hides the real problem behind a practical problem.

The member feels their empty and meaningless existence can never be improved, and therefore, to represent it accurately, the practical problem needs to be a problem that cannot be solved.

### Insoluble problems

This leads to listeners being faced with a very wide range of insoluble problems. The most common type simply contains two elements that can't possibly exist together. The final step is to pass the insoluble problem on to the listener to solve:

|Member:|I hate my job but I can't leave.
||Tell me what to do.
{:.chat}

In many cases the insoluble problem is not as obvious as this. In the chat you might explore the elements of the problem for a long time before the final "Tell me what to do" arrives.

Of course, listeners must not try to solve members' problems. Listeners provide emotional support by reflecting members' feelings. If you detect an insoluble problem, and there's no other feeling to reflect, then the feeling that the problem is insoluble is the best you can do:

|Listener:|You hate it, but leaving is not a solution. The problems feels insoluble.
{:.chat}

If you focus on the job as a literal problem, the member might become hostile because the real problem is their feeling of emptiness:

|Listener:|What is it about the job that you hate the most?
||*The member can't answer this, because it was never really about the job.*
|Member:|Aren't you able to understand what I'm telling you in plain language? JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU IDIOT
{:.chat}

If you expose the member's feeling of emptiness, the member might become hostile because you caused them to feel shame:

|Listener:|It's like your existence has no meaning because you're trapped in a job you hate.
||*The member can't tolerate the shame of this.*
|Member:|What makes you think you can judge me like that? JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU IDIOT
{:.chat}

Another possibility is that the member blocks you and reports you for lack of empathy.

From your point of view as a listener, there's no solution to this. A small proportion of members have extreme difficulty communicating directly because of their narcissistic shame. In a chat, this kind of member will set you up to fail one way or another, because they need to see you fail in order for them to feel better about themselves, temporarily.

Remember, if you become very uncomfortable with a chat for any reason, it is strongly recommended that you transfer the member to another listener, or block the member, or both.
